@article{Bahl2023,
abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging shows promise for surgical applications to non-invasively provide spatially-resolved, spectral information. For calibration purposes, a white reference image of a highly-reflective Lambertian surface should be obtained under the same imaging conditions. Standard white references are not sterilizable, and so are unsuitable for surgical environments. We demonstrate the necessity for in situ white references and address this by proposing a novel, sterile, synthetic reference construction algorithm. The use of references obtained at different distances and lighting conditions to the subject were examined. Spectral and color reconstructions were compared with standard measurements qualitatively and quantitatively, using {\$}\backslashDelta E{\$} and normalised RMSE respectively. The algorithm forms a composite image from a video of a standard sterile ruler, whose imperfect reflectivity is compensated for. The reference is modelled as the product of independent spatial and spectral components, and a scalar factor accounting for gain, exposure, and light intensity. Evaluation of synthetic references against ideal but non-sterile references is performed using the same metrics alongside pixel-by-pixel errors. Finally, intraoperative integration is assessed though cadaveric experiments. Improper white balancing leads to increases in all quantitative and qualitative errors. Synthetic references achieve median pixel-by-pixel errors lower than 6.5{\%} and produce similar reconstructions and errors to an ideal reference. The algorithm integrated well into surgical workflow, achieving median pixel-by-pixel errors of 4.77{\%}, while maintaining good spectral and color reconstruction.},

abstract = {Pressure ulcer (also known as pressure sore, bedsore, ischemia, decubitus ulcer) is a global challenge for today's healthcare society. Found in several locations in the human body such as the sacrum, heel, back of the head, shoulder, knee caps, it occurs when soft tissues are under continuous loading and a subject's mobility is restricted (bedbound/chair bound). Blood flow in soft tissues becomes insufficient leading to tissue necrosis (cell death) and pressure ulcer. The subject's physiological parameters (age, body mass index) and types of body support surface materials (mattress) are also factors in the formation of pressure ulcer. The economic impacts of these are huge, and the subject's quality of life is reduced in many ways. There are several methods of detecting and preventing ulceration in human body. Detection depends on assessing local pressure on tissue and prevention on scales of risk used to assess a subject prior to admission. There are also various types of mattresses (air cushioned/liquid filled/foam) available to prevent ulceration. But, despite this work, pressure ulcers remain common.This article reviews the aetiology, cost, detection and prevention of these ulcers.},

abstract = {We present computationally efficient and accurate semiempirical models of light transfer suitable for real-time diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The models predict the diffuse reflectance of both (i) semi-infinite homogeneous and (ii) two-layer media exposed to normal and collimated light. The two-layer medium consisted of a plane-parallel slab of finite thickness over a semi-infinite layer with identical index of refraction but different absorption and scattering properties. The model accounted for absorption and anisotropic scattering, as well as for internal reflection at the medium/air interface. All media were assumed to be nonemitting, strongly forward scattering, with indices of refraction between 1.00 and 1.44 and transport single-scattering albedos between 0.50 and 0.99. First, simple analytical expressions for the diffuse reflectance of the semi-infinite and two-layer media considered were derived using the two-flux approximation. Then, parameters appearing in the analytical expression previously derived were instead fittedtomatch results from more accurate Monte Carlo simulations. A single semiempirical parameter was sufficient to relate the diffuse reflectance to the radiative properties and thickness of the semi-infinite and two-layer media. The present model can be used for a wide range of applications including noninvasive diagnosis of biological tissue. copy; 2009 Optical Society of America.},

In this work, an overview of their composition and properties is outlined, by separating matrix, scattering, and absorbing materials, and discussing the benefits and weaknesses in each category. Matrix materials typically are water, gelatin, agar, polyester or epoxy and polyurethane resin, room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone, or polyvinyl alcohol gels. The water and hydrogel materials provide a soft medium that is biologically and biochemically compatible with addition of organic molecules, and are optimal for scientific laboratory studies. Polyester, polyurethane, and silicone phantoms are essentially permanent matrix compositions that are suitable for routine calibration and testing of established systems. The most common three choices for scatters have been: (1.) lipid based emulsions, (2.) titanium or aluminum oxide powders, and (3.) polymer microspheres. The choice of absorbers varies widely from hemoglobin and cells for biological simulation, to molecular dyes and ink as less biological but more stable absorbers. This review is an attempt to indicate which sets of phantoms are optimal for specific applications, and provide links to studies that characterize main phantom material properties and recipes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

We propose a two-stage IAD algorithm to mitigate profound cross-talk effects in the estimation of the mu ' s in the case of very high mu a. We developed a small sample adaptor kit to allow IS measurements of samples with small sizes using a commercial spectrophotometer. Results showed that: The two-stage IAD substantially eliminated the cross-talks in the mu ' s spectra, thus rectifying mu a accordingly; and the small sized sample measurements led to systematically overestimated mu a values while the spectrum shape well preserved as compared to the normal port size measurements.},

abstract = {Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble dye that was approved by the FDA for biomedical purposes in 1956. Initially used to measure cardiocirculatory and hepatic functions, ICG's fluorescent properties in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum soon led to its application in ophthalmic angiography. In the early 2000s, ICG was formally introduced in neurosurgery as an angiographic tool. In 2016, the authors' group pioneered a novel technique with ICG named second-window ICG (SWIG), which involves infusion of a high dose of ICG (5.0 mg/kg) in patients 24 hours prior to surgery. To date, applications of SWIG have been reported in patients with high-grade gliomas, meningiomas, brain metastases, pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, chordomas, and pinealomas. The applications of ICG have clearly expanded rapidly across different specialties since its initial development. As an NIR fluorophore, ICG has advantages over other FDA-approved fluorophores, all of which are currently in the visible-light spectrum, because of NIR fluorescence's increased tissue penetration and decreased autofluorescence. Recently, interest in the latest applications of ICG in brain tumor surgery has grown beyond its role as an NIR fluorophore, extending into shortwave infrared imaging and integration into nanotechnology. This review aims to summarize reported clinical studies on ICG fluorescence-guided surgery of intracranial tumors, as well as to provide an overview of the literature on emerging technologies related to the utility of ICG in neuro-oncological surgeries, including the following aspects: 1) ICG fluorescence in the NIR-II window; 2) ICG for photoacoustic imaging; and 3) ICG nanoparticles for combined diagnostic imaging and therapy (theranostic) applications. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.10.FOCUS20782},

abstract = {We investigated the suitability of the semi-infinite model of the diffusion equation when using diffuse optical imaging (DOI) to image thin tissues with double boundaries. Both diffuse approximation and Monte Carlo methods were applied to simulate light propagation in the thin tissue model with variable optical parameters and tissue thicknesses. A threshold value of the tissue thickness was defined as the minimum thickness in which the semi-infinite model exhibits the same reflected intensity as that from the double-boundary model and was generated as the final result. In contrast to our initial hypothesis that all optical properties would affect the threshold thickness, our results show that only absorption coefficient is the dominant parameter and the others are negligible. The threshold thickness decreases from 1 cm to 4 mm as the absorption coefficient grows from 0.01 mm-1 to 0.2 mm-1. A look-up curve was derived to guide the selection of the appropriate model during the optical diagnosis of thin tissue cancers.

The prevalence of this condition is increasing globally and with it, the mounting costs of its management. One aspect of management is saving limbs and or digits, a crucial part of this process is assessing tissue viability of skin which is a focus of this review: there are other aspects which are well described in the literature. Amputations are offered to limit the damage resulting from acute/chronic ischaemia. Holstein measured skin perfusion pressure using a radioisotope clearance technique to describe critically ischaemic skin; he found 30 mm Hg as the threshold above which healing may reliably be expected. Recent advances in vascular surgery and related technology have informed evidence-based advice to revascularize and save limbs; in practice, this may leave a wound in the distal skin unhealed; managing these raises questions of tissue viability. Much effort has been made to manage, prevent and to better understand these lower extremity wounds using measurements of tissue oxygen, oxygen saturation and skin imaging. The measurement techniques and their relevant merits are examined in this article. Advances in wound management systems and protocols can also facilitate the repair processes, and those which can have a particular impact on restoring or maintaining tissue perfusion are also discussed in the article.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraoperative image guidance using near-infrared indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) has been used to provide real-time angiographic images during vascular or brain tumor surgery, and it is also being used for spine surgery. OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the benefits and limitations of ICG-VA image-guided surgery for spinal intramedullary tumors through retrospective study. METHODS: ICG-VA was used in 48 cases that were treated surgically over the past 5 yr. The pathological diagnoses of the tumors included astrocytic tumor, ependymal tumor, cavernous malformation, and hemangioblastoma. RESULTS: Localization of normal spinal arteries and veins on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord helped the surgeons determine the length or point of myelotomy. Welldemarcated tumor stain was recognized in limited cases of anaplastic or highly vascularized tumors, whereas the location of cavernous malformation was recognized as an avascular area on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Feeding arteries and tumor stain were well differentiated from draining veins in dorsal hemangioblastomas, but not in intramedullary deep-seated or ventral tumors. The preservation of small perforating branches of the anterior spinal artery after successful resection of the tumor could be well visualized. CONCLUSION: ICG-VA can provide real-time information about vascular flow dynamics during the surgery of spinal intramedullary tumors, and it may help surgeons localize the normal circulation of the spinal cord, as well as the feeding arteries and draining veins, especially in highly vascular tumors. However, the benefits of intraoperative ICG-VAmight be limited for intramedullary deep-seated or ventral tumors.},

abstract = {In order to visualize human skin hemodynamics, we investigated a method that is specifically developed for the visualization of concentrations of oxygenated blood, deoxygenated blood, and melanin in skin tissue from digital RGB color images. Images of total blood concentration and oxygen saturation can also be reconstructed from the results of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Experiments using tissue-like agar gel phantoms demonstrated the ability of the developed method to quantitatively visualize the transition from an oxygenated blood to a deoxygenated blood in dermis. In vivo imaging of the chromophore concentrations and tissue oxygen saturation in the skin of the human hand are performed for 14 subjects during upper limb occlusion at 50 and 250 mm Hg. The response of the total blood concentration in the skin acquired by this method and forearm volume changes obtained from the conventional strain-gauge plethysmograph were comparable during the upper arm occlusion at pressures of both 50 and 250 mm Hg. The results presented in the present paper indicate the possibility of visualizing the hemodynamics of subsurface skin tissue.},

abstract = {Worldwide, chronic wounds are still a major and increasing problem area in medicine with protracted suffering of patients and enormous costs. Beside conventional wound treatment, for instance kinds of oxygen therapy and cold plasma technology have been tested, providing an improvement in the perfusion of wounds and their healing potential, but these methods are unfortunately not sufficiently validated and accepted for clinical practice to date. Using hyperspectral imaging technology in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region with high spectral and spatial resolution, perfusion parameters of tissue and wounds can be determined. We present a new compact hyperspectral camera which can be used in clinical practice. From hyperspectral data the hemoglobin oxygenation (StO2), the relative concentration of hemoglobin [tissue hemoglobin index (THI)] and the so-called NIR-perfusion index can be determined. The first two parameters are calculated from the VIS-part of the spectrum and represent the perfusion of superficial tissue layers, whereas the NIR-perfusion index is calculated from the NIR-part representing the perfusion in deeper layers. First clinical measurements of transplanted flaps and chronic ulcer wounds show, that the perfusion level can be determined quantitatively allowing sensitive evaluation and monitoring for an optimization of the wound treatment planning and for validation of new treatment methods.},

abstract = {In both photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasonic (US) imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. Consequently, with the increased use of combined PA and US (PAUS) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. To this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. Forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, Intralipid({\textregistered}) 20{\%} IV fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while India Ink, Direct Red 81, and Evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. The following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 MHz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 MHz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). Results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. Based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. Thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of PAUS imaging studies.},

abstract = {An integrated review of the transfer of optical radiation into human skin is presented, aimed at developing useful models for photomedicine. The component chromophores of epidermis and stratum corneum in general determine the attenuation of radiation in these layers, moreso than does optical scattering. Epidermal thickness and melanization are important factors for UV wavelengths less than 300 nm, whereas the attenuation of UVA (320-400 nm) and visible radiation is primarily via melanin. The selective penetration of all optical wavelengths into psoriatic skin can be maximized by application of clear lipophilic liquids, which decrease regular reflectance by a refractive-index matching mechanism. Sensitivity to wavelengths less than 320 nm can be enhanced by prolonged aqueous bathing, which extracts urocanic acid and other diffusible epidermal chromophores. Optical properties of the dermis are modelled using the Kubelka-Munk approach, and calculations of scattering and absorption coefficients are presented. This simple approach allows estimates of the penetration of radiation in vivo using noninvasive measurements of cutaneous spectral remittance (diffuse reflectance). Although the blood chromophores Hb, HbO2, and bilirubin determine dermal absorption of wavelengths longer than 320 nm, scattering by collagen fibers largely determines the depths to which these wavelengths penetrate the dermis, and profoundly modifies skin colors. An optical indowexists between 600 and 1300 nm, which offers the possibility of treating large tissue volumes with certain long-wavelength photosensitizers. Moreover, whenever photosensitized action spectra extend across the near UV and/or visible spectrum, judicious choice of wavelength allows some selection of the tissue layers directly affected.},

abstract = {Several skin diseases are characterized by epidermal alterations affecting epidermal thickness. Reference values of epidermal thickness in healthy humans and knowledge of possible differences regarding age, sex, skin phototype, and ethnic origin are essential in research and in clinical practice. The objectives of this systematic review were to provide epidermal thickness reference values for healthy human skin and describe possible effects of measurement methods, age, sex, ethnic origin, and skin phototype. A combined search in the databases Medline and Embase, and other sources were conducted. Searches covered a period from 1946 to 3 June 2020. Included studies were primarily observational and interventional studies providing means and spread values of epidermal thickness estimates in healthy humans, with clear reporting of skin area, age, and measurement method, and optional reporting of sex, ethnic origin, and skin phototype. Data were extracted per skin area and pooled in random-effects models. A total of 142 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 133 in the meta-analysis. Pooled epidermal thickness estimates were calculated for 37 skin areas. The lowest epidermal thickness of 31.2 (95{\%} CI 27.8-34.6) $\mu$m was reported for the penis and the highest of 596.6 (95{\%} CI 443.9-749.3) $\mu$m for the plantar aspect of the foot. Differences in epidermal thickness estimates obtained by histology, optical coherence tomography, and laser scanning microscopy were minor. High-frequency ultrasonography produces systematically higher values. The epidermis was thinner in aged skin. Differences between sexes and among ethnic origins were minor. Epidermal thickness reference values are provided for 37 skin areas. In conclusion, the epidermis tends to become thinner by ageing and does not seem to be influenced by sex. Histology, optical coherence tomography, and laser scanning microscopy might be used interchangeably to measure epidermal thickness, whereas high-frequency ultrasound should not be used.},

The objective of this study was to investigate variability of the optical properties of human skin compartments reported in literature, to explore the underlying rational of this variability and to propose a dataset of values, to better represent an in vivo case and recommend a solution towards a more accurate prediction of light propagation through cutaneous compartments. To achieve this, we undertook a novel, logical yet simple approach. We first reviewed scientific articles published between 1981 and 2013 that reported on skin optical properties, to reveal the spread in the reported quantitative values. We found variations of up to 100-fold. Then we extracted the most trust-worthy datasets guided by a rule that the spectral properties should reflect the specific biochemical composition of each of the skin layers. This resulted in the narrowing of the spread in the calculated photon densities to 6-fold. We conclude with a recommendation to use the identified most robust datasets when estimating light propagation in human skin using Monte Carlo simulations. Alternatively, otherwise follow our proposed strategy to screen any new datasets to determine their biological relevance.},

abstract = {Background: Anastomotic leak is one of the most feared complications of colorectal surgery, and probably linked to poor blood supply to the anastomotic site. Several technologies have been described for intraoperative assessment of bowel perfusion. This systematic review and meta-Analysis aimed to evaluate the most frequently used bowel perfusion assessment modalities in elective colorectal procedures, and to assess their associated risk of anastomotic leak. Technologies included indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser speckle contrast imaging, and hyperspectral imaging. Methods: The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42021297299). A comprehensive literature search was performed using Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science. The final search was undertaken on 29 July 2022. Data were extracted by two reviewers and the MINORS criteria were applied to assess the risk of bias. Results: Some 66 eligible studies involving 11 560 participants were included. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography was most used with 10 789 participants, followed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with 321, hyperspectral imaging with 265, and laser speckle contrast imaging with 185. In the meta-Analysis, the total pooled effect of an intervention on anastomotic leak was 0.05 (95 per cent c.i. 0.04 to 0.07) in comparison with 0.10 (0.08 to 0.12) without. Use of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, or laser speckle contrast imaging was associated with a significant reduction in anastomotic leak. Conclusion: Bowel perfusion assessment reduced the incidence of anastomotic leak, with intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, and laser speckle contrast imaging all demonstrating comparable results.},

Intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) has potentially important applications in procedures such as organ transplantation or colorectal surgery, where successful reperfusion affects the viability and integrity of repaired tissues. In this paper a liquid crystal tuneable filter-based multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope is described. Motion-induced image misalignments are reduced, using feature-based registration, before regression of the tissue reflectance spectra to calculate relative quantities of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. The laparoscope was validated in vivo, during porcine abdominal surgery, by making parallel MSI and blood gas measurements of the small bowel vasculature. Ischaemic conditions were induced by local occlusion of the mesenteric arcade and monitored using the system. The MSI laparoscope was capable of measuring StO 2 over a wide range (30-100{\%}) with a temporal error of +- 7.5{\%}. The imager showed sensitivity to spatial changes in StO 2 during dynamic local occlusions, as well as tracking the recovery of tissues postocclusion.},

abstract = {This study combines non-invasive hyperspectral imaging with an experimentally validated skin optical model and inverse algorithm to monitor diabetic feet of two representative patients. It aims to observe temporal changes in local epidermal thickness and oxyhemoglobin concentration and to gain insight into the progression of foot ulcer formation and healing. Foot ulceration is a debilitating comorbidity of diabetes that may result in loss of mobility and amputation. Inflammation and necrosis preempt ulceration and can result in changes in the skin prior to ulceration and during ulcer healing that affect oxygen delivery and consumption. Previous studies estimated oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations around pre-ulcerative and ulcer sites on the diabetic foot using commercially available hyperspectral imaging systems. These measurements were successfully used to detect tissue at risk of ulceration and predict the healing potential of ulcers. The present study shows epidermal thickening and decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration can also be detected prior to ulceration at pre-ulcerative sites. The algorithm was also able to observe reduction in the epidermal thickness combined with an increase in oxyhemoglobin concentration around the ulcer as it healed and closed. This methodology can be used for early prediction of diabetic foot ulceration in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {In 2012, cancer affected 14.1 million people worldwide and was responsible for 8.2million deaths. The disease predominantly affects aged populations and is one of the leading causes of death in most western countries. In tumors, the aggressive growth of the neoplastic cell population and associated overexpression of pro-angiogenic factors lead to the development of disorganized blood vessel networks that are structurally and functionally different from normal vasculature. A disorganized labyrinth of vessels that are immature, tortuous and hyperpermeable typifies tumor vasculature. Functionally, the ability of the tumor vasculature to deliver nutrients and remove waste products is severely diminished. A critical consequence of the inadequate vascular networks in solid tumors is the development of regions of hypoxia [low oxygen tensions typically defined as oxygen tensions (pO2 values) {\textless} 10mm Hg]. Tumor cells existing in such hypoxic environments have long been known to be resistant to anticancer therapy, display an aggressive phenotype, and promote tumor progression and dissemination. This review discusses the physiological basis of hypoxia, methods of detection, and strategies to overcome the resulting therapy resistance.},

abstract = {Significance: The estimation of tissue oxygenation is vital in the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of a huge assortment of diseases. The hyperspectral (HS) imaging system is a rising innovation that can be utilized to build a highly sensitive, non-invasive, and tissue hemoglobin immersion map. Objective: As a result of the urgent need to design and implement early detection devices and applications for the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose building a non-invasive custom optical imaging system to assist with phlebotomy and vascular approach to survey the reliability of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels recovered from spectral images. Materials and Methods: HS images were gathered from 15 healthy subjects without previous medical history complications and with an average age range of 20 to 38 years, who were undergoing phlebotomy. The forearm was vigorously illuminated utilizing an HS camera with polychromatic source light of spectrum range (400-980 nm). Spectroscopic reflectance images were caught by a focal plane exhibit for the region of interest (ROI). Then the custom algorithm comprising normalization and moving average filtering for noise removal was applied, followed by K-mean clustering for image segmentation to visualize and highlight the arteries and the veins in the investigated forearm. Results: The investigations show that after normalization of the recorded signal from the HS camera of the participating subjects it was noticed that at wavelength of 460 nm the oxygenated arteries had a stronger signal than the de-oxygenated veins, and at a wavelength of 750 nm the de-oxygenated veins had a stronger signal than the oxygenated arteries. Thus, the ideal wavelength to reveal the oxygenated arteries was 460 nm, and the ideal wavelength to reveal the de-oxygenated veins was 750 nm. Conclusions: HSI is a prospective technique to assist with phlebotomy and non-contact oxygen saturation approach. Additionally, it may permit future surgical or pharmacological intercessions that titrate or limit ischemic injury continuously.},

abstract = {Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sensors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013-2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation.},

abstract = {Background: Tissue necrosis, a consequence of inadequate tissue oxygenation, is a common post-operative complication. As current surgical assessments are often limited to visual and tactile feedback, additional techniques that can aid in the interrogation of tissue viability are needed to improve patient outcomes. In this bi-institutional pilot study, the performance of a novel snapshot hyperspectral imaging camera to detect superficial cutaneous oxygen saturation (StO2) was evaluated. Methods: Healthy human volunteers were recruited at two participating centers. Cutaneous StO2 of the forearm was determined by a snapshot hyperspectral camera on two separate study days during occlusionreperfusion of the brachial artery and after induction of local vasodilation. To calculate the blood StO2 at each pixel in the multispectral image, spectra were selected, and fitting was performed over wavelengths ranging from 470 to 950 nm. Results: Quantitative detection of physiological changes in cutaneous StO2 levels was feasible in all sixteen volunteers. A significant (P{\textless}0.001) decrease in cutaneous StO2 levels from 78.3{\%} (SD: 15.3) at baseline to 60.6{\%} (SD: 19.8) at the end of occlusion phase was observed, although StO2 levels returned to baseline after five minutes. Mean cutaneous StO2 values were similar in the same subjects on separate study days (Pearson R2: 0.92 and 0.77, respectively) at both centers. Local vasodilation did not yield significant changes in cutaneous StO2 values. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a snapshot hyperspectral camera for detecting quantitative physiological changes in cutaneous StO2 in normal human volunteers, and serves as a precursor for further validation in perioperative studies.},

@article{Hackethal2018,
abstract = {Modern surgical strategies aim to reduce trauma by using functional imaging to improve surgical outcomes. This reviews considers and evaluates the importance of the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) to visualize lymph nodes, lymphatic pathways and vessels and tissue borders in an interdisciplinary setting. The work is based on a selective search of the literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and the authors? own clinical experience. Because of its simple, radiation-free and uncomplicated application, ICG has become an important clinical indicator in recent years. In oncologic surgery ICG is used extensively to identify sentinel lymph nodes with promising results. In some studies, the detection rates with ICG have been better than the rates obtained with established procedures. When ICG is used for visualization and the quantification of tissue perfusion, it can lead to fewer cases of anastomotic insufficiency or transplant necrosis. The use of ICG for the imaging of organ borders, flap plasty borders and postoperative vascularization has also been scientifically evaluated. Combining the easily applied ICG dye with technical options for intraoperative and interventional visualization has the potential to create new functional imaging procedures which, in future, could expand or even replace existing established surgical techniques, particularly the techniques used for sentinel lymph node and anastomosis imaging.},
