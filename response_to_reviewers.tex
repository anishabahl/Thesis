\section{Detailed Answer to amendments in examiner report}

We thank you for your careful reading of our manuscript and your helpful comments, including those regarding the strengths and limitations of the study.

\reviewcomment{1}{1}{
 The spectra of the phantoms do not completely follow Hb and HbO2; this should include quantification of this difference and a discussion of how this affects the ability to use these phantoms to test systems.
}

\response{
We agree that this is limitation of our study which could have been better emphasised.
Our discussion now reads: 
\begin{quoting}
Similarly, haemoglobin chromophores could not be utilised in the phantoms due to their oxygen sensitivity which could not be controlled within the spectrophotometer measurement set-up. This led us to rely on stable synthetic dyes instead\textcolor{red}{, which do not perfectly replicate the spectra of oxy and deoxyhaemoglobin. The major dye peaks maxima are approximately 45nm lower than the distinctive haemoglobin peaks which may contribute to different wavelength regions performing differently with these phantoms compared to biological samples}.
\end{quoting}
}

\reviewcomment{1}{2}{The lack of spatial information in the phantoms does not address the ability of systems to determine both spectral and spatial resolution. This can be important in MSI systems as resolution might vary at different wavelengths. Please include this in your discussion.}

\response{
Whilst spatial resolution characterisation is critical to the effective use of HSI systems, this is beyond the scope of this work which aims to evaluate the analytical $StO_2$ methods.
We therefore prefer to refer the reader to publications dedicated to this topic.
This consideration is added to our discussion which now reads: 
\begin{quoting}
    \textcolor{red}{These phantoms are also spatially uniform meaning that, whilst these could be used to determine the performance of these models spatially using hyperspectral imaging systems, other methods would be required to assess spatial resolution of these systems \cite{EdmundOptics2023, Torkildsen2018}.} 
\end{quoting}
}

\reviewcomment{1}{3}{Please add labels to Figure 1(a) to indicate what each part of the phantom shows}

\response{
This figure shows some baseline components used in phantom synthesis and the caption has been revised to clarify this. The revised figure is reproduced as \figref{fig:phantommethods1} in this letter.

\reviewcomment{1}{5}{Iâ€™m not sure what the CT scan adds to the paper. It should be better addressed.}

\response{
We agree that the rationale for using a CT scan is could have been strengthened. This has now been done in Section 2.2.2 of the revised manuscript which we reproduce here.
\begin{quoting}
    In order to obtain accurate optical properties from IAD a highly accurate sample depth must be provided. \textcolor{red}{The standard measurement technique using dial calipers is not suitable in this case due to the highly compressible nature of the gelatin-based phantoms.
    A non-contact measurement method is therefore chosen. A} CT scan is taken of each phantom using a Small Animal Radiotherapy System (SmART+, precision X-ray). A mean of 10 digital measurements is used for each phantom and an example of these measurements is shown in Figure 1c [Note: \figref{fig:phantommethods1}c in this letter].
\end{quoting}
The caption for Figure 1c has also been amended as shown in \figref{fig:phantommethods1} c in this letter.

\reviewcomment{1}{6}{Finally, please discuss the downsides/trade-offs of the phantoms.}

\response{
This has been added to the discussion also in line with our answers to the previous comments. The revised text is reproduced below. 
\begin{quoting}
    Firstly, whilst every effort was made to synthesise optical phantoms resembling biological tissue, measurements of true biological tissue could not be used for this work due to a lack of reliable ground truth parameters in tissue.
%, alongside challenges in integration to the surgical work flow since the surgical procedure cannot continue during the in-vivo data capture process. 
Similarly, haemoglobin chromophores could not be utilised in the phantoms due to their oxygen sensitivity which could not be controlled within the spectrophotometer measurement set-up. This led us to rely on stable synthetic dyes instead\textcolor{red}{, which do not perfectly replicate the spectra of oxy and deoxyhaemoglobin. The major dye peaks maxima are approximately 45nm lower than the distinctive haemoglobin peaks which may contribute to different wavelength regions performing differently with these phantoms compared to biological samples}. \textcolor{red}{The factors chosen to allow approximately equal impact from each dye were chosen to ease synthesis and should be optimised. Since these factors are incorporated in both synthesis and analysis, it is believed that these do not impact the conclusions of this study.}\textcolor{red}{The difference in extinction coefficient found when measuring each dye in gelatin compared to aqueous solution is not fully understood and requires further study.}\textcolor{red}{These phantoms are also spatially uniform meaning that, whilst these could be used to determine the performance of these models spatially using hyperspectral imaging systems, other methods would be required to assess spatial resolution of these systems \cite{EdmundOptics2023, Torkildsen2018}.} Secondly, the shift in absorbance of the third chromophore made it difficult to model thereby limiting the investigation of the impact of additional chromophores.
%
Thirdly, whilst the IAD method produces results similar to our ground truth, there remain some differences between IAD output and the expected ground truth.
This could impact the quality of the intralipid scattering model used in this work.
