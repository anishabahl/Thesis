This is an unofficial latex template for a thesis with either a King's College London or a UCL cover page and some functionalities that may be convenient.

There is no official mandatory King's or UCL template and this template is just one possible template that hopefully meets the requirements. Formatting requirements can be found at:

- https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/exams-and-assessments/research-assessments/format-bind-and-submit-your-thesis-general-guidance

Note that an officially supported latex template exists for UCL:
