abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows for the acquisition of large numbers of spectral bands throughout the electromagnetic spectrum (within and beyond the visual range) with respect to the surface of scenes captured by sensors. Using this information and a set of complex classification algorithms, it is possible to determine which material or substance is located in each pixel. The work presented in this paper aims to exploit the characteristics of HSI to develop a demonstrator capable of delineating tumor tissue from brain tissue during neurosurgical operations. Improved delineation of tumor boundaries is expected to improve the results of surgery. The developed demonstrator is composed of two hyperspectral cameras covering a spectral range of 400-1700 nm. Furthermore, a hardware accelerator connected to a control unit is used to speed up the hyperspectral brain cancer detection algorithm to achieve processing during the time of surgery. A labeled dataset comprised of more than 300,000 spectral signatures is used as the training dataset for the supervised stage of the classification algorithm. In this preliminary study, thematic maps obtained from a validation database of seven hyperspectral images of in vivo brain tissue captured and processed during neurosurgical operations demonstrate that the system is able to discriminate between normal and tumor tissue in the brain. The results can be provided during the surgical procedure ({\~{}}1 min), making it a practical system for neurosurgeons to use in the near future to improve excision and potentially improve patient outcomes.},

Images of total blood concentration and oxygen saturation can also be reconstructed from the results of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Experiments using tissue-like agar gel phantoms demonstrated the ability of the developed method to quantitatively visualize the transition from an oxygenated blood to a deoxygenated blood in dermis. In vivo imaging of the chromophore concentrations and tissue oxygen saturation in the skin of the human hand are performed for 14 subjects during upper limb occlusion at 50 and 250 mm Hg. The response of the total blood concentration in the skin acquired by this method and forearm volume changes obtained from the conventional strain-gauge plethysmograph were comparable during the upper arm occlusion at pressures of both 50 and 250 mm Hg. The results presented in the present paper indicate the possibility of visualizing the hemodynamics of subsurface skin tissue.},

abstract = {Adipose (fat) tissue is a complex metabolic organ that is highly active and essential. In contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) is deemed metabolically beneficial because of its ability to burn calories through heat production. The conversion of WAT-resident adipocytes to “beige” or “brown-like” adipocytes has recently attracted attention. However, it typically takes a few days to analyze and confirm this browning of WAT through conventional molecular, biochemical, or histological methods. Moreover, accurate quantification of the overall browning process is not possible by any of these methods. In this context, we report the novel application of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and multispectral imaging (MSI) to detect and quantify the browning process in mice. We successfully demonstrated the time-dependent increase in browning of WAT, following its induction through $\beta$-adrenergic agonist injections. The results from these optical techniques were confirmed with those of standard molecular and biochemical assays, which measure gene and protein expression levels of UCP1 and PGC-1$\alpha$, as well as with histological examinations. We envision that the reported optical methods can be developed into a fast, real time, cost effective and easy to implement imaging approach for quantification of the browning process in adipose tissue.},

abstract = {Early detection and resection of adenomatous polyps prevents their progression to colorectal cancer (CRC), significantly improving patient outcomes. Polyps are typically identified and removed during white-light colonoscopy. Unfortunately, the rate of interval cancers that arise between CRC screening events remains high, linked to poor visualization of polyps during screening and incomplete polyp removal. Here, we sought to evaluate the potential of a hyperspectral endoscope (HySE) to enhance polyp discrimination for detection and resection. We designed, built and tested a new compact HySE in a proof-of-concept clinical study. We successfully collected spectra from three tissue types in seven patients undergoing routine colonoscopy screening. The acquired spectral data from normal tissue and polyps, both pre- and post- resection, were subjected to quantitative analysis using spectral angle mapping and machine learning, which discriminated the data by tissue type, meriting further investigation of HySE as a clinical tool.},

In-depth knowledge of target tissue optical properties across a wide-wavelength spectrum could inform the design of optical imaging and computational methods to enable robust tissue analysis during surgery. We adapted a dual-beam integrating sphere to analyse small tissue samples and investigated ex vivo optical properties of five types of human brain tumour (meningioma, pituitary adenoma, schwannoma, low- and high-grade glioma) and nine different types of healthy brain tissue across a wavelength spectrum of 400 to 1800 nm. Fresh and frozen tissue samples were analysed. All tissue types demonstrated similar absorption spectra, but the reduced scattering coefficients of tumours show visible differences in the obtained optical spectrum compared to those of surrounding normal tissue. These results underline the potential of optical imaging technologies for intraoperative tissue characterization.},

abstract = {Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) is based on the binary modulation of the spatial-spectral scene, which allows for hyperspectral image reconstruction from 2D compressive measurement. However, the actual optical modulation does not match the current image formation model due to the extra optical phenomena, such as diffraction, distortion, optical misalignment, and dispersion, inside the system. It is a long-lasting problem that the gap between the simplified image formation model and the actual optical modulation degrades the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a high-accuracy image formation model to reduce this gap in CASSI. Specifically, we first reformulate the spectral modulation as channel-wise convolution, in which the convolution kernel represents the point-spread-function (PSF) of each spectral channel. Then, according to our key observation that the calibration images are the blurred versions of the coded aperture, we propose to estimate the PSF by exploring the relationship between these blurred and non-blurred pairs. In addition, we also provide a theoretical analysis of the PSF's influences on the reconstruction quality, which can serve as a guide for CASSI system implementation. Our simulations and real system experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Purpose Optical imaging is evolving as a key technique for advanced sensing in the operating room. Recent research has shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to address the inverse problem of converting pixel-wise multispectral reflectance measurements to underlying tissue parameters, such as oxygenation. Assessment of the specific hardware used in conjunction with such algorithms, however, has not properly addressed the possibility that the problem may be ill-posed. Methods We present a novel approach to the assessment of optical imaging modalities, which is sensitive to the different types of uncertainties that may occur when inferring tissue parameters. Based on the concept of invertible neural networks, our framework goes beyond point estimates and maps each multispectral measurement to a full posterior probability distribution which is capable of representing ambiguity in the solution via multiple modes. Performance metrics for a hardware setup can then be computed from the characteristics of the posteriors. Results Application of the assessment framework to the specific use case of camera selection for physiological parameter estimation yields the following insights: (1) estimation of tissue oxygenation from multispectral images is a well-posed problem, while (2) blood volume fraction may not be recovered without ambiguity. (3) In general, ambiguity may be reduced by increasing the number of spectral bands in the camera. Conclusion Our method could help to optimize optical camera design in an application-specific manner.},

abstract = {In 2012, cancer affected 14.1 million people worldwide and was responsible for 8.2million deaths. The disease predominantly affects aged populations and is one of the leading causes of death in most western countries. In tumors, the aggressive growth of the neoplastic cell population and associated overexpression of pro-angiogenic factors lead to the development of disorganized blood vessel networks that are structurally and functionally different from normal vasculature. A disorganized labyrinth of vessels that are immature, tortuous and hyperpermeable typifies tumor vasculature. Functionally, the ability of the tumor vasculature to deliver nutrients and remove waste products is severely diminished. A critical consequence of the inadequate vascular networks in solid tumors is the development of regions of hypoxia [low oxygen tensions typically defined as oxygen tensions (pO2 values) {\textless} 10mm Hg]. Tumor cells existing in such hypoxic environments have long been known to be resistant to anticancer therapy, display an aggressive phenotype, and promote tumor progression and dissemination. This review discusses the physiological basis of hypoxia, methods of detection, and strategies to overcome the resulting therapy resistance.},

At about the same time, new models of color constancy appeared, along with physiological data on cortical mechanisms and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes. Since then, as this review shows, there have been many advances. The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, an overview of their composition and properties is outlined, by separating matrix, scattering, and absorbing materials, and discussing the benefits and weaknesses in each category. Matrix materials typically are water, gelatin, agar, polyester or epoxy and polyurethane resin, room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone, or polyvinyl alcohol gels. The water and hydrogel materials provide a soft medium that is biologically and biochemically compatible with addition of organic molecules, and are optimal for scientific laboratory studies. Polyester, polyurethane, and silicone phantoms are essentially permanent matrix compositions that are suitable for routine calibration and testing of established systems. The most common three choices for scatters have been: (1.) lipid based emulsions, (2.) titanium or aluminum oxide powders, and (3.) polymer microspheres. The choice of absorbers varies widely from hemoglobin and cells for biological simulation, to molecular dyes and ink as less biological but more stable absorbers. This review is an attempt to indicate which sets of phantoms are optimal for specific applications, and provide links to studies that characterize main phantom material properties and recipes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

abstract = {Introduction: Surgical resection remains the first-line treatment for gliomas. Several fluorescent dyes are currently in use to augment intraoperative tumor visualization, but information on their comparative effectiveness is lacking. We performed systematic assessment of fluorescein sodium (FNa), 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)–induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence in various glioma models using advanced fluorescence imaging techniques. Methods: Four glioma models were used: GL261 (high-grade model), GB3 (low-grade model), and an in utero electroporation model with and without red fluorescence protein (IUE +RFP and IUE -RFP, respectively) (intermediate-to-low-grade model). Animals underwent 5-ALA, FNa, and ICG injections and craniectomy. Brain tissue samples underwent fluorescent imaging using a wide-field operative microscope and a benchtop confocal microscope and were submitted for histologic analysis. Results: Our systematic analysis showed that wide-field imaging of highly malignant gliomas is equally efficient with 5-ALA, FNa, and ICG, although FNa is associated with more false-positive staining of the normal brain. In low-grade gliomas, wide-field imaging cannot detect ICG staining, can detect FNa in only 50{\%} of specimens, and is not sensitive enough for PpIX detection. With confocal imaging of low-intermediate grade glioma models, PpIX outperformed FNa. Discussion: Overall, compared to wide-field imaging, confocal microscopy significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and was better at detecting low concentrations of PpIX and FNa, resulting in improved tumor delineation. Neither PpIX, FNa, nor ICG delineated all tumor boundaries in studied tumor models, which emphasizes the need for novel visualization technologies and molecular probes to guide glioma resection. Simultaneous administration of 5-ALA and FNa with use of cellular-resolution imaging modalities may provide additional information for margin detection and may facilitate maximal glioma resection.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral sensors have great potential in crop monitoring due to their high flexibility, high spatial resolution, and ease of operation. Image preprocessing, however, is a prerequisite to make full use of the acquired high-quality data in practical applications. Most crop monitoring studies have focused on specific procedures or applications, and there has been little attempt to examine the accuracy of the data preprocessing steps. This study focuses on the preprocessing process of a six-band multispectral camera (Mini-MCA6) mounted on UAVs. First, we have quantified and analyzed the components of sensor error, including noise, vignetting, and lens distortion. Next, different methods of spectral band registration and radiometric correction were evaluated. Then, an appropriate image preprocessing process was proposed. Finally, the applicability and potential for crop monitoring were assessed in terms of accuracy by measurement of the leaf area index (LAI) and the leaf biomass inversion under variable growth conditions during five critical growth stages of winter wheat. The results show that noise and vignetting could be effectively removed via use of correction coefficients in image processing. The widely used Brown model was suitable for lens distortion correction of a Mini-MCA6. Band registration based on ground control points (GCPs) (Root-Mean-Square Error, RMSE = 1.02 pixels) was superior to that using PixelWrench2 (PW2) software (RMSE = 1.82 pixels). For radiometric correction, the accuracy of the empirical linear correction (ELC) method was significantly higher than that of light intensity sensor correction (ILSC) method. The multispectral images that were processed using optimal correction methods were demonstrated to be reliable for estimating LAI and leaf biomass. This study provides a feasible and semi-automatic image preprocessing process for a UAV-based Mini-MCA6, which also serves as a reference for other array-type multispectral sensors. Moreover, the high-quality data generated in this study may stimulate increased interest in remote high-efficiency monitoring of crop growth status.},

abstract = {Rapid advancement of novel optical spectroscopy and imaging systems relies on the availability of well-characterised and reproducible protocols for phantoms as a standard for the validation of the technique. The tissue-mimicking phantoms are also used to investigate photon transport in biological samples before clinical trials that require well-characterized phantoms with known optical properties (reduced scattering ($\mu$′s) and absorption ($\mu$a) coefficients). However, at present, there is limited literature available providing well-characterized phantom recipes considering various biomarkers and tested over a wide range of optical properties covering most of the human organs and applicable to multimodal optical spectroscopy. In this study, gelatin-based phantoms were designed to simulate tissue optical properties where India ink and Intralipid were used as absorbing and scattering agents, respectively. Multiple biomarkers were simulated by varying the gelatin concentration to mimic the change in tissue hydration and hydroxyapatite concentration to mimic bone signature. The recipe along with biomarkers were optimized and characterised over a wide range of optical properties ($\mu$a from 0.1 to 0.5 cm−1; $\mu$′s from 5 to 15 cm−1) relevant to human tissue using a broadband time-domain diffuse optical spectrometer. The data collected showed a linear relationship between the concentration of ink/lipids and $\mu$a/$\mu$′s values with negligible coupling between $\mu$a and $\mu$′s values. While being stored in a refrigerator post-fabrication, the $\mu$a and $\mu$′s did not change significantly ({\textless}4{\%} coefficient of variation, ‘CV') over three weeks. The reproducibility in three different sets was validated experimentally and found to be strong with a variation of ≤6{\%} CV in $\mu$a and ≤9{\%} CV in $\mu$′s. From the 3 × 3 data of $\mu$a and $\mu$′s matrices, one can deduce the recipe for any target absorption or reduced scattering coefficient. The applicability of the phantoms was tested using diffuse reflectance and Raman spectrometers. A use case application was demonstrated for Raman spectroscopy where hydration and hydroxyapatite phantoms were designed to characterize the Raman instrument. The Raman instrument could detect the change in 1{\%} of HA and 5{\%} of hydration. This study presents a first-of-its-kind robust, well-characterized, multi-biomarker phantom recipe for calibration and benchmarking of multimodal spectroscopy devices assisting in their clinical translation.},

abstract = {Background: Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) captures spectral information that has been shown to characterise tissues. Since the surgeon's naked eye is sometimes unable to differentiate between tumour and normal brain, HSI could be a solution. Aims: We aim to develop an intra-operative HSI system capable of tumour detection and delineation. Methods: Using a newly developed HSI system that captures images across the visible and near-infrared electromagnetic spectrum (from 400nm to 1700nm); we obtained hyperspectral images during tumour resection. Before imaging, markers were placed at the location of the tumour and normal brain. Images were then captured with the markers insitu. Tissue samples were obtained from the location of the markers and sent for tissue diagnosis. A pre-processing chain was then applied to the spectrum of each pixel within the hyperspectral images. The spectra and pixels within the areas marked areas were then labelled with their tissue diagnosis. This labelled data was then used to produce and test algorithms that automatically classified images from their spectral signatures. Results: Using data from 22 resections, we have developed algorithms capable of automatically identifying tumour and normal brain from hyperspectral images. Furthermore, the algorithms were capable of producing a 2D colour map correlating to the location of the tumour and normal brain. Conclusion: The HELICoid project has made excellent progress and current results are very promising. However, more images are needed in order for us to produce a validated HSI system capable of providing real time intra-operative information on tumour type, grade and location.},

abstract = {Pressure ulcer (also known as pressure sore, bedsore, ischemia, decubitus ulcer) is a global challenge for today's healthcare society. Found in several locations in the human body such as the sacrum, heel, back of the head, shoulder, knee caps, it occurs when soft tissues are under continuous loading and a subject's mobility is restricted (bedbound/chair bound). Blood flow in soft tissues becomes insufficient leading to tissue necrosis (cell death) and pressure ulcer. The subject's physiological parameters (age, body mass index) and types of body support surface materials (mattress) are also factors in the formation of pressure ulcer. The economic impacts of these are huge, and the subject's quality of life is reduced in many ways. There are several methods of detecting and preventing ulceration in human body. Detection depends on assessing local pressure on tissue and prevention on scales of risk used to assess a subject prior to admission. There are also various types of mattresses (air cushioned/liquid filled/foam) available to prevent ulceration. But, despite this work, pressure ulcers remain common.This article reviews the aetiology, cost, detection and prevention of these ulcers.},

abstract = {Several skin diseases are characterized by epidermal alterations affecting epidermal thickness. Reference values of epidermal thickness in healthy humans and knowledge of possible differences regarding age, sex, skin phototype, and ethnic origin are essential in research and in clinical practice. The objectives of this systematic review were to provide epidermal thickness reference values for healthy human skin and describe possible effects of measurement methods, age, sex, ethnic origin, and skin phototype. A combined search in the databases Medline and Embase, and other sources were conducted. Searches covered a period from 1946 to 3 June 2020. Included studies were primarily observational and interventional studies providing means and spread values of epidermal thickness estimates in healthy humans, with clear reporting of skin area, age, and measurement method, and optional reporting of sex, ethnic origin, and skin phototype. Data were extracted per skin area and pooled in random-effects models. A total of 142 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 133 in the meta-analysis. Pooled epidermal thickness estimates were calculated for 37 skin areas. The lowest epidermal thickness of 31.2 (95{\%} CI 27.8–34.6) $\mu$m was reported for the penis and the highest of 596.6 (95{\%} CI 443.9–749.3) $\mu$m for the plantar aspect of the foot. Differences in epidermal thickness estimates obtained by histology, optical coherence tomography, and laser scanning microscopy were minor. High-frequency ultrasonography produces systematically higher values. The epidermis was thinner in aged skin. Differences between sexes and among ethnic origins were minor. Epidermal thickness reference values are provided for 37 skin areas. In conclusion, the epidermis tends to become thinner by ageing and does not seem to be influenced by sex. Histology, optical coherence tomography, and laser scanning microscopy might be used interchangeably to measure epidermal thickness, whereas high-frequency ultrasound should not be used.},

abstract = {In the increasingly pressing context of improving recycling, optical technologies present a broad potential to support the adequate sorting of plastics. Nevertheless, the commercially available solutions (for example, employing near-infrared spectroscopy) generally focus on identifying mono-materials of a few selected types which currently have a market-interest as secondary materials. Current progress in photonic sciences together with advanced data analysis, such as artificial intelligence, enable bridging practical challenges previously not feasible, for example in terms of classifying more complex materials. In the present paper, the different techniques are initially reviewed based on their main characteristics. Then, based on academic literature, their suitability for monitoring the composition of multi-materials, such as different types of multi-layered packaging and fibre-reinforced polymer composites as well as black plastics used in the motor vehicle industry, is discussed. Finally, some commercial systems with applications in those sectors are also presented. This review mainly focuses on the materials identification step (taking place after waste collection and before sorting and reprocessing) but in outlook, further insights on sorting are given as well as future prospects which can contribute to increasing the circularity of the plastic composites' value chains.},

abstract = {Purpose: Live intra-operative functional imaging has multiple potential clinical applications, such as localization of ischemia, assessment of organ transplantation success and perfusion monitoring. Recent research has shown that live monitoring of functional tissue properties, such as tissue oxygenation and blood volume fraction, is possible using multispectral imaging in laparoscopic surgery. While the illuminant spectrum is typically kept constant in laparoscopic surgery and can thus be estimated from preoperative calibration images, a key challenge in open surgery originates from the dynamic changes of lighting conditions. Methods: The present paper addresses this challenge with a novel approach to light source calibration based on specular highlight analysis. It involves the acquisition of low-exposure time images serving as a basis for recovering the illuminant spectrum from pixels that contain a dominant specular reflectance component. Results: Comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments with a range of different light sources demonstrate that our approach enables an accurate and robust recovery of the illuminant spectrum in the field of view of the camera, which results in reduced errors with respect to the estimation of functional tissue properties. Our approach further outperforms state-of-the-art methods proposed in the field of computer vision. Conclusion: Our results suggest that low-exposure multispectral images are well suited for light source calibration via specular highlight analysis. This work thus provides an important first step toward live functional imaging in open surgery.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a fiber optic probe is a promising technique for evaluating the optical properties of biological tissue. We herein present a method for determining the reduced scattering coefficient, $\mu$ 0s , the absorption coefficient, $\mu$ a, and the tissue oxygen saturation, StO2, of in vivo brain tissue using a single-reflectance fiber probe with two source-collector geometries. We performed in vivo recordings of diffuse reflectance spectra and of the electrophysiological signals for exposed rat brain during the cortical spreading depression evoked by the topical application of KCl. The time courses of $\mu$ a at 500, 570, and 584 nm indicated the hemodynamic change in the cerebral cortex as well as StO2. At 570 nm, the time course of $\mu$ 0s was well correlated with that of $\mu$ a, which also reflects the scattering by RBCs. On the other hand, increases in $\mu$ 0s at 500 and 584 nm and a decrease in $\mu$ 0s at 800 nm were observed before the profound increase in $\mu$ a, and these occurrences were synchronized with the negative dc shift of the local field potential. The resultant change in the slope of $\mu$ 0s .+ is indicative of the morphological changes in the cellular and subcellular structures induced by the depolarization due to the temporal depression of the neuronal bioelectrical activity. The results of the present study indicate the potential application of the proposed method in evaluating the pathophysiological conditions of in vivo brain.},

The work is based on a selective search of the literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar and the authors? own clinical experience. Because of its simple, radiation-free and uncomplicated application, ICG has become an important clinical indicator in recent years. In oncologic surgery ICG is used extensively to identify sentinel lymph nodes with promising results. In some studies, the detection rates with ICG have been better than the rates obtained with established procedures. When ICG is used for visualization and the quantification of tissue perfusion, it can lead to fewer cases of anastomotic insufficiency or transplant necrosis. The use of ICG for the imaging of organ borders, flap plasty borders and postoperative vascularization has also been scientifically evaluated. Combining the easily applied ICG dye with technical options for intraoperative and interventional visualization has the potential to create new functional imaging procedures which, in future, could expand or even replace existing established surgical techniques, particularly the techniques used for sentinel lymph node and anastomosis imaging.},

abstract = {Background: Pulse oximeters are routinely used in community and hospital settings worldwide as a rapid, non-invasive, and readily available bedside tool to approximate blood oxygenation. Potential racial biases in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements may influence the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings and impact clinical decision making. We aimed to assess whether the accuracy of oxygen saturation measured by SpO2, relative to arterial blood gas (SaO2), varies by ethnicity. Methods: In this large retrospective observational cohort study covering four NHS Hospitals serving a large urban population in Birmingham, United Kingdom, consecutive pairs of SpO2 and SaO2 measurements taken on the same patient within an interval of less than 20 min were identified from electronic patient records. Where multiple pairs of measurements were recorded in a spell, only the first was included in the analysis. The differences between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements were compared across groups of self-identified ethnicity. These differences were subsequently adjusted for age, sex, bilirubin, systolic blood pressure, carboxyhaemaglobin saturations and the time interval between SpO2 and SaO2 measurements. Findings: Paired O2 saturation measurements from 16,818 inpatient spells between 1st January 2017 and 18th February 2021 were analysed. The cohort self-identified as being of White (81.2{\%}), Asian (11.7{\%}), Black (4.0{\%}), or Other (3.2{\%}) ethnicities. Across the cohort, SpO2 was statistically significantly higher than SaO2 (p {\textless} 0.0001), with medians of 98{\%} (interquartile range [IQR]: 95–100{\%}) vs. 97{\%} (IQR: 96–99{\%}), and a median difference of 0.5{\%} points (pps; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.5–0.6). However, the size of this difference varied considerably with the magnitude of SaO2, with SpO2 overestimating by a median by 3.8pp (IQR: 0.4, 8.8) for SaO2 values {\textless}90{\%} but underestimating by a median of 0.4pp (IQR: -2.0, 1.4) for an SaO2 of 95{\%}. The differences between SpO2 and SaO2 were also found to vary by ethnicity, with this difference being 0.8pp (95{\%} CI: 0.6–1.0, p {\textless} 0.0001) greater in those of Black vs. White ethnicity. These differences resulted in 8.7{\%} vs. 6.1{\%} of Black vs. White patients who were classified as normoxic on SpO2 actually being hypoxic on the gold standard SaO2 (odds ratio: 1.47, 95{\%} CI: 1.09–1.98, p = 0.012). Interpretation: Pulse oximetry may overestimate O2 saturation, and this is possibly more pronounced in patients of Black ethnicity.

abstract = {Introduction: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown promise in the field of intra-operative imaging and tissue differentiation as it carries the capability to provide real-time information invisible to the naked eye whilst remaining label free. Previous iterations of intra-operative HSI systems have shown limitations, either due to carrying a large footprint limiting ease of use within the confines of a neurosurgical theater environment, having a slow image acquisition time, or by compromising spatial/spectral resolution in favor of improvements to the surgical workflow. Lightfield hyperspectral imaging is a novel technique that has the potential to facilitate video rate image acquisition whilst maintaining a high spectral resolution. Our pre-clinical and first-in-human studies (IDEAL 0 and 1, respectively) demonstrate the necessary steps leading to the first in-vivo use of a real-time lightfield hyperspectral system in neuro-oncology surgery. Methods: A lightfield hyperspectral camera (Cubert Ultris ×50) was integrated in a bespoke imaging system setup so that it could be safely adopted into the open neurosurgical workflow whilst maintaining sterility. Our system allowed the surgeon to capture in-vivo hyperspectral data (155 bands, 350–1,000 nm) at 1.5 Hz. Following successful implementation in a pre-clinical setup (IDEAL 0), our system was evaluated during brain tumor surgery in a single patient to remove a posterior fossa meningioma (IDEAL 1). Feedback from the theater team was analyzed and incorporated in a follow-up design aimed at implementing an IDEAL 2a study. Results: Focusing on our IDEAL 1 study results, hyperspectral information was acquired from the cerebellum and associated meningioma with minimal disruption to the neurosurgical workflow. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of HSI acquisition with 100+ spectral bands at a frame rate over 1Hz in surgery. Discussion: This work demonstrated that a lightfield hyperspectral imaging system not only meets the design criteria and specifications outlined in an IDEAL-0 (pre-clinical) study, but also that it can translate into clinical practice as illustrated by a successful first in human study (IDEAL 1). This opens doors for further development and optimisation, given the increasing evidence that hyperspectral imaging can provide live, wide-field, and label-free intra-operative imaging and tissue differentiation.},

Microsurgical clipping is considered the best long-term treatment, despite of the increase of endovascular interventional treatments in the latest years. Vascular control is a pivotal concept for aneurysms surgery, which provides the application of temporary clip in case of rupture, whereas the application of permanent clip requires the perfect knowledge of aneurysm anatomy. Several techniques to obtain the obliteration of the aneurysm while preserving the parent vessels and its branches have been described. Micro-Doppler ultrasonography (MUSG), indocyanine green video angi-ography (ICG-VA), and electrophysiological neuromonitoring (IONM) are all useful intraoperative tools, which can improve the safety of surgical procedures and achieve the goal of aneurysm obliteration with parent vessel and perforating preservation.},

We aim to assess the accuracy of SRH in a novel range of sinonasal and skull base tumors. Methods: Select patients undergoing sinonasal and skull base surgery using the Invenio Imaging™ Nio™ Laser Imaging SRH system between June 2020 and September 2021 were assessed. The SRH images were reviewed for pathologic features similar to frozen section (FS) and FFPE. Time taken for results and diagnostic concordance was assessed. Results: Sixty-seven SRH images from 7 tumor types in 12 patients were assessed. Pathologies included squamous cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, inverted papilloma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, SMARCB1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma, mucosal melanoma, metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma, and meningioma. Tumor was identified in 100{\%} of lesional specimens, with characteristic diagnostic features readily appreciable on SRH. Median time for diagnosis was significantly faster for SRH (4.3 min) versus FS (44.5 min; p = {\textless}.0001). Where SRH sample site matched precisely to FS (n = 32/67, 47.8{\%}), the same diagnosis was confirmed in 93.8{\%}. Sensitivity, specificity, precision, and overall accuracy of SRH were 93.3{\%}, 94.1{\%}, 93.8{\%}, and 93.3{\%}, respectively. Near-perfect concordance was seen between SRH and FS (Cohen's kappa [$\kappa$] = 0.89). Conclusion: Stimulated Raman histology can rapidly produce images similar to FFPE H{\&}E in sinonasal and skull base tumors. This technology has the potential to act as an adjunct or alternative to standard FS. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 132:2142–2147, 2022.},

abstract = {The Adding-Doubling (AD) algorithm is a general analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation (RTE). AD offers a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, surpassing other RTE solutions, such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, in terms of speed while outperforming approximate solutions like the Diffusion Approximation method in accuracy. While AD algorithms have traditionally been implemented on central processing units (CPUs), this study focuses on leveraging the capabilities of graphics processing units (GPUs) to achieve enhanced computational speed. In terms of processing speed, the GPU AD algorithm showed an improvement by a factor of about 5000 to 40,000 compared to the GPU MC method. The optimal number of threads for this algorithm was found to be approximately 3000. To illustrate the utility of the GPU AD algorithm, the Levenberg–Marquardt inverse solution was used to extract object parameters from optical spectral data of human skin under various hemodynamic conditions. With regards to computational efficiency, it took approximately 5 min to process a 220 × 100 × 61 image (x-axis × y-axis × spectral-axis). The development of the GPU AD algorithm presents an advancement in determining tissue properties compared to other RTE solutions. Moreover, the GPU AD method itself holds the potential to expedite machine learning techniques in the analysis of spectral images.},

abstract = {Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble dye that was approved by the FDA for biomedical purposes in 1956. Initially used to measure cardiocirculatory and hepatic functions, ICG's fluorescent properties in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum soon led to its application in ophthalmic angiography. In the early 2000s, ICG was formally introduced in neurosurgery as an angiographic tool. In 2016, the authors' group pioneered a novel technique with ICG named second-window ICG (SWIG), which involves infusion of a high dose of ICG (5.0 mg/kg) in patients 24 hours prior to surgery. To date, applications of SWIG have been reported in patients with high-grade gliomas, meningiomas, brain metastases, pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, chordomas, and pinealomas. The applications of ICG have clearly expanded rapidly across different specialties since its initial development. As an NIR fluorophore, ICG has advantages over other FDA-approved fluorophores, all of which are currently in the visible-light spectrum, because of NIR fluorescence's increased tissue penetration and decreased autofluorescence. Recently, interest in the latest applications of ICG in brain tumor surgery has grown beyond its role as an NIR fluorophore, extending into shortwave infrared imaging and integration into nanotechnology. This review aims to summarize reported clinical studies on ICG fluorescence–guided surgery of intracranial tumors, as well as to provide an overview of the literature on emerging technologies related to the utility of ICG in neuro-oncological surgeries, including the following aspects: 1) ICG fluorescence in the NIR-II window; 2) ICG for photoacoustic imaging; and 3) ICG nanoparticles for combined diagnostic imaging and therapy (theranostic) applications. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.10.FOCUS20782},

abstract = {Background: Anastomotic leak is one of the most feared complications of colorectal surgery, and probably linked to poor blood supply to the anastomotic site. Several technologies have been described for intraoperative assessment of bowel perfusion. This systematic review and meta-Analysis aimed to evaluate the most frequently used bowel perfusion assessment modalities in elective colorectal procedures, and to assess their associated risk of anastomotic leak. Technologies included indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser speckle contrast imaging, and hyperspectral imaging. Methods: The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42021297299). A comprehensive literature search was performed using Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science. The final search was undertaken on 29 July 2022. Data were extracted by two reviewers and the MINORS criteria were applied to assess the risk of bias. Results: Some 66 eligible studies involving 11 560 participants were included. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography was most used with 10 789 participants, followed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with 321, hyperspectral imaging with 265, and laser speckle contrast imaging with 185. In the meta-Analysis, the total pooled effect of an intervention on anastomotic leak was 0.05 (95 per cent c.i. 0.04 to 0.07) in comparison with 0.10 (0.08 to 0.12) without. Use of indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, or laser speckle contrast imaging was associated with a significant reduction in anastomotic leak. Conclusion: Bowel perfusion assessment reduced the incidence of anastomotic leak, with intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography, hyperspectral imaging, and laser speckle contrast imaging all demonstrating comparable results.},

The RBC prior is derived from a statistical property of vignetting-free images: for the pixels sharing the same radius in polar coordinates of an image, at least one pixel has a high intensity value at some color channel. Exploiting the prior, we can effectively estimate and correct the vignetting effect of a given image. We represent the vignetting effect as an 1D function of the distance from the optical center, and estimate the function using the RBC prior. As it works completely in 1D, our method provides high efficiency in terms of computation and storage costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs an order of magnitude faster than previous work, while producing higher quality results of vignetting correction. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

These measurements can be used for estimation of important physiological parameters, such as oxygenation, which can provide indicators for the success of surgical treatment or the presence of abnormal tissue. The goal of this work was to develop a method to estimate physiological parameters in an accurate and rapid manner suited for modern high-resolution laparoscopic images. Methods: While previous methods for oxygenation estimation are based on either simple linear methods or complex model-based approaches exclusively suited for off-line processing, we propose a new approach that combines the high accuracy of model-based approaches with the speed and robustness of modern machine learning methods. Our concept is based on training random forest regressors using reflectance spectra generated with Monte Carlo simulations. Results: According to extensive in silico and in vivo experiments, the method features higher accuracy and robustness than state-of-the-art online methods and is orders of magnitude faster than other nonlinear regression based methods. Conclusion: Our current implementation allows for near real-time oxygenation estimation from megapixel multispectral images and is thus well suited for online tissue analysis.},

The LCTF is continuously tunable within its useful visible spectral range (525-725 nm) with an average spectral full width at half-height bandwidth of 0.38 nm and an average transmittance of 10.0{\%}.

abstract = {Introduction: Treatment of extended defects after tumor resection in oral, maxillofacial, and facial surgery (craniomaxillofacial) is usually performed by free microvascular flaps. Evaluation of flap survival is crucial, especially in the first hours after insertion and connection. For flap evaluation various invasive and noninvasive methods have been developed. This retrospective clinical study examined the ability of a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) camera (Tivita, Diaspective Vision, Germany) to assess postoperative flap properties in comparison to established clinical parameters. Materials and Methods: Thirteen patients with tumor resection and free flap reconstruction were included for camera analysis and another 10 patients as control group. For this purpose, at defined time intervals and under standardized conditions, recordings of transplants 3 to 100 hours postoperatively were performed. Images were used to examine oxygenation (StO2{\%}), tissue hemoglobin index, tissue water index, near infrared range perfusion index of free flaps quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: HSI provides values differing between patients observed with no intraindividual significant difference. After 24 hours a mean reduction of 16.77{\%} for StO2{\%}, 9.16{\%} for tissue hemoglobin index and 8.46{\%} was observed, going in line with no loss of flap was noted in the observation period. Conclusion: HSI is suitable as a noninvasive measure for the evaluation of free flaps in craniomaxillofacial surgery in case of stable imaging conditions with respect to light, surrounding and position of the camera. However, clinical measurements are still the method of choice.},

abstract = {Objectives: Surgical margin status is a significant determinant of treatment outcome in oral cancer. Negative surgical margins can decrease the loco-regional recurrence by five-fold. The current standard of care of intraoperative clinical examination supplemented by histological frozen section, can result in a risk of positive margins from 5 to 17 percent. In this study, we attempted to assess the utility of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging with automated diagnostic algorithm to improve on the current method of clinical evaluation of surgical margin in oral cancer. Materials and methods: We have used a modified handheld OCT device with automated algorithm based diagnostic platform for imaging. Intraoperatively, images of 125 sites were captured from multiple zones around the tumor of oral cancer patients (n = 14) and compared with the clinical and pathologic diagnosis. Results: OCT showed sensitivity and specificity of 100{\%}, equivalent to histological diagnosis (kappa, ĸ = 0.922), in detection of malignancy within tumor and tumor margin areas. In comparison, for dysplastic lesions, OCT-based detection showed a sensitivity of 92.5{\%} and specificity of 68.8{\%} and a moderate concordance with histopathology diagnosis (ĸ = 0.59). Additionally, the OCT scores could significantly differentiate squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from dysplastic lesions (mild/moderate/severe; p ≤ 0.005) as well as the latter from the non-dysplastic lesions (p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion: The current challenges associated with clinical examination-based margin assessment could be improved with intra-operative OCT imaging. OCT is capable of identifying microscopic tumor at the surgical margins and demonstrated the feasibility of mapping of field cancerization around the tumor.},

abstract = {Considering the increasing use of lasers in neurosurgery and the increasing number of wavelengths of laser light becoming available, we evaluated optical properties between 200 and 900 nm of meninges, normal human brain tissue, and brain tumors. We used at two-beam spectral photometer with an integrating sphere as the measuring instrument. The material consisted of 13 brains and 1 specimen each of dura mater, falx, and arachnoid obtained at autopsy and 30 samples of brain tumors removed during operation. In tissue samples more than 5 mm thick, the relative levels of absorption and scattering were estimated from the relative level of reflection measured according to the Kubelka-Munk theory. In thin tissue slices, penetration depth was calculated according to Beer's law from measurements of reflection and transmission. Generally, in all tissues there was an increase of reflection, scattering, and penetration depth and a decrease of absorption from the ultraviolet up to the near infrared spe ctral range interrupted by the absorption bands of hemoglobin. Within the ultraviolet spectral range, no major differences of optical properties were observed. Within the visible and near infrared spectral range, white matter reflected most of the incident power and showed the lowest level of absorption and the shortest penetration depth. Low grade gliomas revealed optical properties similar to those of gray matter. In comparison with normal brain tissue meningiomas and glioblastomas showed significantly higher levels of absorption calculated according to the Kubelka-Munk theory from reflection measurements in thick tissue samples, but also deeper penetration obtained from measurements of reflection and transmission in thin slices, especially within the near infrared spectral range.},

abstract = {A model-based inversion method was used to obtain quantitative estimates of histological parameters from multispectral images of the colon and to examine their potential for discriminating between normal and pathological tissues. Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. In the second (inversion) stage the parameter values were obtained via optimization using an iterated conditional modes algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields. The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 2.04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, precancerous and noncancerous colon lesions. The key signs of abnormality were shown to be the increase in the blood volume fraction and decrease in the density of scattering particles. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Establishing blood vessel patency in neurovascular surgery is an essential component in treating cerebrovascular disorders. Given the difficulty in confirming complete obliteration of the aneurysm sac, ICG videoangiography has emerged as an intraoperative tool that provides neurosurgeons immediate feedback on the status of vessel flow, allowing for surgical modifications to be made without delay. ICG initially emerged as a tool for assessing hepatic, cardiac, and retinovascular function. It is an inert compound with a high affinity for plasma proteins and fluorescence properties making it the ideal candidate for assessment of vessel patency in neurovascular procedures. Requiring only a bolus peripheral vein injection and integration of a near-infrared imaging device into the surgical microscope, ICG can be visualized without disrupting operating room workflow or the surgical field. Quick response time, high-spatial resolution, and low complication rates are features of ICG videoangiography that prove advantageous when compared to the gold standard intra- and postoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Despite this, ICG is not without limitations, specifically in the setting of atherosclerotic vessels, giant, and complex aneurysms. Additionally, there are instances where DSA may prove superior in detecting vessel stenosis and outflow obstruction, prompting the recommendation of ICG as an adjunct to, rather than complete replacement of DSA. In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the biochemical properties and historical origins of ICG viedoangiography in addition to discussing its current application in aneurysm surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intraoperative image guidance using near-infrared indocyanine green videoangiography (ICG-VA) has been used to provide real-time angiographic images during vascular or brain tumor surgery, and it is also being used for spine surgery. OBJECTIVE: To further investigate the benefits and limitations of ICG-VA image-guided surgery for spinal intramedullary tumors through retrospective study. METHODS: ICG-VA was used in 48 cases that were treated surgically over the past 5 yr. The pathological diagnoses of the tumors included astrocytic tumor, ependymal tumor, cavernous malformation, and hemangioblastoma. RESULTS: Localization of normal spinal arteries and veins on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord helped the surgeons determine the length or point of myelotomy. Welldemarcated tumor stain was recognized in limited cases of anaplastic or highly vascularized tumors, whereas the location of cavernous malformation was recognized as an avascular area on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Feeding arteries and tumor stain were well differentiated from draining veins in dorsal hemangioblastomas, but not in intramedullary deep-seated or ventral tumors. The preservation of small perforating branches of the anterior spinal artery after successful resection of the tumor could be well visualized. CONCLUSION: ICG-VA can provide real-time information about vascular flow dynamics during the surgery of spinal intramedullary tumors, and it may help surgeons localize the normal circulation of the spinal cord, as well as the feeding arteries and draining veins, especially in highly vascular tumors. However, the benefits of intraoperative ICG-VAmight be limited for intramedullary deep-seated or ventral tumors.},

abstract = {We investigated the suitability of the semi-infinite model of the diffusion equation when using diffuse optical imaging (DOI) to image thin tissues with double boundaries. Both diffuse approximation and Monte Carlo methods were applied to simulate light propagation in the thin tissue model with variable optical parameters and tissue thicknesses. A threshold value of the tissue thickness was defined as the minimum thickness in which the semi-infinite model exhibits the same reflected intensity as that from the double-boundary model and was generated as the final result. In contrast to our initial hypothesis that all optical properties would affect the threshold thickness, our results show that only absorption coefficient is the dominant parameter and the others are negligible. The threshold thickness decreases from 1 cm to 4 mm as the absorption coefficient grows from 0.01 mm-1 to 0.2 mm-1. A look-up curve was derived to guide the selection of the appropriate model during the optical diagnosis of thin tissue cancers. These results are useful in guiding the development of the endoscopic DOI for esophageal, cervical and colorectal cancers, among others. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease. Relentless cyst growth substantially enlarges both kidneys and culminates in renal failure. Patients with ADPKD also have vascular abnormalities; intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are found in {\^{a}} 1/410{\%} of asymptomatic patients during screening and in up to 25{\%} of those with a family history of IA or subarachnoid haemorrhage. As the genes responsible for ADPKD - PKD1 and PKD2 - have complex integrative roles in mechanotransduction and intracellular calcium signalling, the molecular basis of IA formation might involve focal haemodynamic conditions exacerbated by hypertension and altered flow sensing. IA rupture results in substantial mortality, morbidity and poor long-term outcomes. In this Review, we focus mainly on strategies for screening, diagnosis and treatment of IAs in patients with ADPKD. Other vascular aneurysms and anomalies - including aneurysms of the aorta and coronary arteries, cervicocephalic and thoracic aortic dissections, aortic root dilatation and cerebral dolichoectasia - are less common in this population, and the available data are insufficient to recommend screening strategies. Treatment decisions should be made with expert consultation and be based on a risk-benefit analysis that takes into account aneurysm location and morphology as well as patient age and comorbidities.},

abstract = {The adoption of spectral imaging by industry has so far been limited due to the lack of high speed, low cost and compact spectral cameras. Moreover most state-of-the-art spectral cameras utilize some form of spatial or spectral scanning during acquisition, making them ill-suited for analyzing dynamic scenes containing movement. This paper introduces a novel snapshot multispectral imager concept based on optical filters monolithically integrated on top of a standard CMOS image sensor. It overcomes the problems mentioned for scanning applications by snapshot acquisition, where an entire multispectral data cube is sensed at one discrete point in time. This is enabled by depositing interference filters per pixel directly on a CMOS image sensor, extending the traditional Bayer color imaging concept to multi- or hyperspectral imaging without a need for dedicated fore-optics. The monolithic deposition leads to a high degree of design flexibility. This enables systems ranging from application-specific, high spatial resolution cameras with 1 to 4 spectral filters, to hyperspectral snapshot cameras at medium spatial resolutions and filters laid out in cells of 4x4 to 6x6 or more. Through the use of monolithically integrated optical filters it further retains the qualities of compactness, low cost and high acquisition speed, differentiating it from other snapshot spectral cameras.},

It aims to observe temporal changes in local epidermal thickness and oxyhemoglobin concentration and to gain insight into the progression of foot ulcer formation and healing. Foot ulceration is a debilitating comorbidity of diabetes that may result in loss of mobility and amputation. Inflammation and necrosis preempt ulceration and can result in changes in the skin prior to ulceration and during ulcer healing that affect oxygen delivery and consumption. Previous studies estimated oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations around pre-ulcerative and ulcer sites on the diabetic foot using commercially available hyperspectral imaging systems. These measurements were successfully used to detect tissue at risk of ulceration and predict the healing potential of ulcers. The present study shows epidermal thickening and decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration can also be detected prior to ulceration at pre-ulcerative sites. The algorithm was also able to observe reduction in the epidermal thickness combined with an increase in oxyhemoglobin concentration around the ulcer as it healed and closed. This methodology can be used for early prediction of diabetic foot ulceration in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel imaging system for video-rate spectral imaging in the clinical workflow. The system integrates a small snapshot multispectral camera with a standard laparoscope and a clinically commonly used light source, enabling the recording of multispectral images with a spectral dimension of 16 at a frame rate of 25 Hz. An ongoing in patient study shows that multispectral recordings from this system can help detect perfusion changes in partial nephrectomy surgery, thus opening the doors to a wide range of clinical applications.},

Tumor oxygenation studies at microvascular levels can provide understanding of oxygen transport on scales at which oxygen transfer to tissue occurs. To fully grasp the significance of blood oxygen delivery and hypoxia at microvascular levels during tumor growth and angiogenesis, the spatial and temporal relationship of the data must be preserved and mapped. Using tumors grown in window chamber models, hyperspectral imaging can provide serial spatial maps of blood oxygenation in terms of hemoglobin saturation at the microvascular level. We describe our application of hyperspectral imaging for in vivo microvascular tumor oxygen transport studies using red fluorescent protein (RFP) to identify all tumor cells, and hypoxia-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the hypoxic fraction. 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, stably transfected with both reporter genes, are grown in dorsal skin-fold window chambers. Hyperspectral imaging is used to create image maps of hemoglobin saturation, and classify image pixels where RFP alone is present (tumor cells), or both RFP and GFP are present (hypoxic tumor cells). In this work, in vivo calibration of the imaging system is described and in vivo results are shown.},

Patients and Methods: Thirty-seven patients who were undergoing complex open PN (median R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry of 8) at our institution underwent renal oxygenation assessment using DLP-HSI. Percent renal parenchymal oxyhemoglobin ({\%}HbO2) during AO vs AV occlusion was recorded and its correlation with postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was investigated using Pearson correlation. AO and AV occlusion was performed in 12 and 25 patients, respectively. Results: Comparing AO vs AV, mean ischemia time was 41 vs 35 minutes (P=0.02). The {\%}HbO2 at baseline was 73.6{\%} vs 71{\%} (P=0.23). After hilar occlusion, {\%}HbO2 quickly reached an "ischemic plateau" in both groups, with mean ischemic {\%}HbO2 measures of 59.7{\%} vs 62.2{\%} (P=0.19). In the AV group, a lower mean ischemic {\%}HbO2 was associated with lower eGFR at the most recent follow-up (r=0.46, P=0.02) and remained significant on multivariable analysis (odds ratio 2.31; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.29-4.32; P=0.03). Conclusions: In this pilot clinical study, renal oxygenation profiles during PN as assessed by DLP-HSI were similar for AO vs AV occlusion. Significant retrograde venous oxygen delivery using an AO occlusion technique could not be demonstrated. There was also no renal functional advantage for AO occlusion in this population of difficult PN where prolonged ischemia times may have mitigated any advantage. Further study in cases with shorter ischemia times is warranted. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) has emerged over the past decade as a powerful, yet simple, method for imaging of blood flow dynamics in real time. The rapid adoption of LSCI for physiological studies is due to the relative ease and low cost of building an instrument as well as the ability to quantify blood flow changes with excellent spatial and temporal resolution. Although measurements are limited to superficial tissues with no depth resolution, LSCI has been instrumental in pre-clinical studies of neurological disorders as well as clinical applications including dermatological, neurosurgical and endoscopic studies. Recently a number of technical advances have been developed to improve the quantitative accuracy and temporal resolution of speckle imaging. This article reviews some of these recent advances and describes several applications of speckle imaging. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

Standard monitoring techniques in the NICU focus on arterial oxygen supply and hemodynamics and include respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry but provide only limited information on end organ oxygen delivery. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy can bridge this gap by displaying continuous measurements of tissue oxygen saturation, providing information on the balance of oxygen delivery and consumption in organs of interest.

For complex geometry and multilayer structures computer simulation has to be used for light transport analysis. A Monte Carlo model of light propagation in tissue has been applied for the purpose of better understanding of the results of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements in experimental tumors. The major objective was to determine the percentage and location of the illuminated area in tumor and to estimate fraction of NIRS signal originating from the underlying tissues. Values of optical parameters used in the model were taken from literature. Tumor shape was approximated with a rotational ellipsoid. Computer simulations were made for two positions of optodes: reflectance and transmittance mode. Results of simulations indicate that in both configurations the majority of signal originates from tumor and not from surrounding tissue. In reflectance mode collected light comes from limited area near the optode whereas in transmittance mode the collected light illuminate almost whole tumor. This difference between the two modes is valid for all tissue parameters.},

The objective of this study was to investigate variability of the optical properties of human skin compartments reported in literature, to explore the underlying rational of this variability and to propose a dataset of values, to better represent an in vivo case and recommend a solution towards a more accurate prediction of light propagation through cutaneous compartments. To achieve this, we undertook a novel, logical yet simple approach. We first reviewed scientific articles published between 1981 and 2013 that reported on skin optical properties, to reveal the spread in the reported quantitative values. We found variations of up to 100-fold. Then we extracted the most trust-worthy datasets guided by a rule that the spectral properties should reflect the specific biochemical composition of each of the skin layers. This resulted in the narrowing of the spread in the calculated photon densities to 6-fold. We conclude with a recommendation to use the identified most robust datasets when estimating light propagation in human skin using Monte Carlo simulations. Alternatively, otherwise follow our proposed strategy to screen any new datasets to determine their biological relevance.},

@article{Doron2022,
abstract = {Background: Temporary clipping is an important tool in the vascular neurosurgeon's armamentarium. We routinely utilize intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) for complex brain aneurysm surgery cases, relying on direct cortical motor evoked potential (DCMEP) alerts to guide the duration of temporary clipping. Previous studies have argued for relatively short and intermittent temporary clipping strategies. In this study, we sought to assess the maximal permissive temporary clipping time during complex aneurysm surgery. To do this, we assessed patient outcome in relation to temporary clip duration guided by DCMEP. Methods: We queried our prospectively collected neuromonitoring database for anterior circulation aneurysm cases where temporary clipping was utilized by a single cerebrovascular surgeon between 2018 and 2021. Operative and IONM reports were reviewed. Patients in whom the duration of temporary clipping could not be determined were excluded. The operative strategy permissively allowed continuous temporary clipping as long as no neuromonitoring alerts were encountered. Maximal permissive parent artery occlusion time (Clipmax) was recorded as the longest duration of tolerated temporary vessel clipping without decrement in DCMEP. Results: A total of 41 complex anterior circulation aneurysm clipping cases met criteria for this study. The mean Clipmax for all cases was just over 19 min and did not differ between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Initial alert times were not found to be predictive of final permissive temporary clip duration after re-perfusion. In 100{\%} (41/41) of cases, the aneurysm was completely clip occluded without residual on catheter angiogram. Stable or improved modified Rankin Score was achieved in 98{\%} (40/41) of cases at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that using DCMEP can facilitate relatively long but safe temporary clipping durations in complex anterior circulation aneurysm surgery. In the endovascular era with only a limited subset of technically challenging aneurysms needing open surgical treatment, extended permissive temporary clipping guided by DCMEPs can significantly enhance a surgeon's ability to achieve excellent technical and clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging shows promise for surgical applications to non-invasively provide spatially-resolved, spectral information. For calibration purposes, a white reference image of a highly-reflective Lambertian surface should be obtained under the same imaging conditions. Standard white references are not sterilizable, and so are unsuitable for surgical environments. We demonstrate the necessity for in situ white references and address this by proposing a novel, sterile, synthetic reference construction algorithm. The use of references obtained at different distances and lighting conditions to the subject were examined. Spectral and color reconstructions were compared with standard measurements qualitatively and quantitatively, using {\$}\backslashDelta E{\$} and normalised RMSE respectively. The algorithm forms a composite image from a video of a standard sterile ruler, whose imperfect reflectivity is compensated for. The reference is modelled as the product of independent spatial and spectral components, and a scalar factor accounting for gain, exposure, and light intensity. Evaluation of synthetic references against ideal but non-sterile references is performed using the same metrics alongside pixel-by-pixel errors. Finally, intraoperative integration is assessed though cadaveric experiments. Improper white balancing leads to increases in all quantitative and qualitative errors. Synthetic references achieve median pixel-by-pixel errors lower than 6.5{\%} and produce similar reconstructions and errors to an ideal reference. The algorithm integrated well into surgical workflow, achieving median pixel-by-pixel errors of 4.77{\%}, while maintaining good spectral and color reconstruction.},

However, there have been no reports describing the details of Monte Carlo modeling of lens based non-contact setup for depth sensitive diffuse reflectance measurements to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we first presented a flexible Monte Carlo method to model non-contact diffuse reflectance measurements in a lens based setup. Then this method was used to simulate diffuse reflectance measurements from a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissue model in the cone shell, cone and hybrid configurations, in which the cone shell configuration has not been previously proposed in optical spectroscopy. Depth sensitive measurements were achieved by adjusting the following two parameters: (1) the depth of focal point of the imaging lens in the SCC model; and (2) the cone radius in the cone configuration or the ring radius in the cone shell configuration. It was demonstrated that the cone shell and the hybrid configurations in general have better depth sensitivity to the tumor and the stroma than the more commonly used cone configuration for diffuse reflectance measurements in the SCC model.},

abstract = {Background: Tissue necrosis, a consequence of inadequate tissue oxygenation, is a common post-operative complication. As current surgical assessments are often limited to visual and tactile feedback, additional techniques that can aid in the interrogation of tissue viability are needed to improve patient outcomes. In this bi-institutional pilot study, the performance of a novel snapshot hyperspectral imaging camera to detect superficial cutaneous oxygen saturation (StO2) was evaluated. Methods: Healthy human volunteers were recruited at two participating centers. Cutaneous StO2 of the forearm was determined by a snapshot hyperspectral camera on two separate study days during occlusionreperfusion of the brachial artery and after induction of local vasodilation. To calculate the blood StO2 at each pixel in the multispectral image, spectra were selected, and fitting was performed over wavelengths ranging from 470 to 950 nm. Results: Quantitative detection of physiological changes in cutaneous StO2 levels was feasible in all sixteen volunteers. A significant (P{\textless}0.001) decrease in cutaneous StO2 levels from 78.3{\%} (SD: 15.3) at baseline to 60.6{\%} (SD: 19.8) at the end of occlusion phase was observed, although StO2 levels returned to baseline after five minutes. Mean cutaneous StO2 values were similar in the same subjects on separate study days (Pearson R2: 0.92 and 0.77, respectively) at both centers. Local vasodilation did not yield significant changes in cutaneous StO2 values. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a snapshot hyperspectral camera for detecting quantitative physiological changes in cutaneous StO2 in normal human volunteers, and serves as a precursor for further validation in perioperative studies.},

abstract = {The use of hyperspectral imaging for medical applications is becoming more common in recent years. One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.},

Hyperspectral imaging (HI) detects PPIX more sensitively but is not yet ready for intraoperative use. We illustrate the current status with three experiments and summarize our own experience using HI: (1) assessment of HI analysis algorithm using pig brain tissue, (2) a partially retrospective evaluation of our experience from HI projects, and (3) device comparison of surgical microscopy and HI. In (1), we address the problem that current algorithms for evaluating HI data are based on calibration with liquid phantoms, which have limitations. Their pH is low compared to glioma tissue; they provide only one PPIX photo state and only PPIX as fluorophore. Testing the HI algorithm with brain homogenates, we found proper correction for optical properties but not pH. Considerably more PPIX was measured at pH 9 than at pH 5. In (2), we indicate pitfalls and guide HI application. In (3), we found HI superior to the microscope for biopsy diagnosis (AUC = 0.845 ± 0.024 (cut-off 0.75 µg PPIX/ml) vs. 0.710 ± 0.035).

abstract = {Background The knowledge of hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2) and tissue oxygenation is critical to identify the presence of shock and therapeutic options. The resonance vibrational enhancement of hemoglobin allows measurement of oxy- and deoxy species of hemoglobin and resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS-StO2) has been successfully used to measure aggregate microvascular oxygenation. We tested the hypothesis that noninvasive oxygen saturation measured by RRS-StO2could serve as surrogate of systemic central venous SO2. Methods In anesthetized rats, measurements of RRS-StO2made in oral mucosa, skin, muscle, and liver were compared with measurements of central venous SO2using traditional multi-wavelength oximetry. Various oxygenation levels were obtained using a stepwise hemorrhage while over 100 paired blood samples and Raman-based measurements were performed. The relationships between RRS-StO2and clinically important systemic blood parameters were also evaluated. RRS-StO2measurements were made in 3-mm diameter tissue areas using a microvascular oximeter and a handheld probe. Results Significant correlations were found between venous SO2and RRS-StO2measurements made in the oral mucosa (r = 0.913, P {\textless} 0.001), skin (r = 0.499, P {\textless} 0.01), and liver (r = 0.611, P {\textless} 0.05). The mean difference between sublingual RRS-StO2and blood sample SO2values was 5.4 ± 1.6{\%}. Sublingual RRS-StO2also correlated with lactate (r = 0.909, P {\textless} 0.01), potassium (r = 0.757, P {\textless} 0.01), and pH (r = 0.703, P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Raman-based oxygen saturation is a promising technique for the noninvasive evaluation of oxygenation in skin, thin tissues, and solid organs. Under certain conditions, sublingual RRS-StO2measurements correlate with central venous SO2.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of intraoperative angiography to assess the results of neurovascular surgery is increasing. The purpose of this study was to measure the radiation dose to patients and personnel during intraoperative angiography and to determine the effect of experience. METHODS: Fifty consecutive intraoperative angiographic studies were performed during aneurysmal clipping or arteriovenous malformation resection from June 1993 to December 1993 and another 50 from December 1994 to June 1995. Data collected prospectively included fluoroscopy time, digital angiography time, number of views, and amount of time the radiologist spent in the room. Student's t-test was used to assess statistical significance. Effective doses were calculated from radiation exposure measurements using adult thoracic and head phantoms. RESULTS: The overall median examination required 5.2 minutes of fluoroscopy, 55 minutes of operating room use, 40 seconds of digital angiographic series time, and four views and runs. The mean room time and the number of views and runs increased in the second group of patients. A trend toward reduced fluoroscopy time was noted. Calculated effective doses for median values were as follows: patient, 76.7 millirems (mrems); radiologist, 0.028 mrems; radiology technologist, 0.044 mrems; and anesthesiologist, 0.016 mrems. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative angiography is performed with a reasonable radiation dose to the patient and personnel. The number of angiographic views and the radiologist's time in the room increase with experience.},

Their high spectral resolution over a wide range of wavelengths enables acquisition of spatial information corresponding to different light-interacting biological compounds. This review focuses on the application of HSI to monitor brain tissue metabolism and hemodynamics in life sciences. Different approaches involving HSI have been investigated to assess and quantify cerebral activity, mainly focusing on: (1) mapping tissue oxygen delivery through measurement of changes in oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin; and (2) the assessment of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) to estimate oxygen consumption by brain tissue. Finally, we introduce future perspectives of HSI of brain metabolism, including its potential use for imaging optical signals from molecules directly involved in cellular energy production. HSI solutions can provide remarkable insight in understanding cerebral tissue metabolism and oxygenation, aiding investigation on brain tissue physiological processes.},

Semi-infinite samples are required in such cases. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology for calculating the optical absorption and reduced scattering of biological tissues of small size from IS measurements at 400-1800 nm. We propose a two-stage IAD algorithm to mitigate profound cross-talk effects in the estimation of the µ ′ s in the case of very high µ a. We developed a small sample adaptor kit to allow IS measurements of samples with small sizes using a commercial spectrophotometer. Results showed that: The two-stage IAD substantially eliminated the cross-talks in the µ ′ s spectra, thus rectifying µ a accordingly; and the small sized sample measurements led to systematically overestimated µ a values while the spectrum shape well preserved as compared to the normal port size measurements.},

We compare these analytical models using Monte Carlo simulated diffuse reflectance spectra and controlled gelatin-based phantoms with measured diffuse reflectance spectra and known ground truth composition parameters. The Yudovsky model performed best against Monte Carlo simulations and measured spectra of tissue phantoms in terms of goodness of fit and parameter extraction accuracy followed closely by Jacques' model. In this study, Yudovsky's model appeared most robust, however our results demonstrated that both Yudovsky and Jacques models are suitable for modelling tissue that can be approximated as a single, homogeneous, semi-infinite slab.},

abstract = {Multispectral imaging in laparoscopy can provide tissue reflectance measurements for each point in the image at multiple wavelengths of light. These reflectances encode information on important physiological parameters not visible to the naked eye. Fast decoding of the data during surgery, however, remains challenging. While model-based methods suffer from inaccurate base assumptions, a major bottleneck related to competing machine learning-based solutions is the lack of labelled training data. In this paper, we address this issue with the first transfer learning-based method to physiological parameter estimation from multispectral images. It relies on a highly generic tissue model that aims to capture the full range of optical tissue parameters that can potentially be observed in vivo. Adaptation of the model to a specific clinical application based on unlabelled in vivo data is achieved using a new concept of domain adaptation that explicitly addresses the high variance often introduced by conventional covariance-shift correction methods. According to comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments our approach enables accurate parameter estimation for various tissue types without the need for incorporating specific prior knowledge on optical properties and could thus pave the way for many exciting applications in multispectral laparoscopy.},

abstract = {Real-time investigation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration (HbO, HbR) dynamics has been difficult until recently due to limited spatial and temporal resolution of techniques like laser Doppler flowmetry and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The combination of laser speckle flowmetry (LSF) and multispectral reflectance imaging (MSRI) yields high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of hemodynamic and metabolic changes in response to functional cortical activation. During acute focal cerebral ischemia, changes in HbO and HbR are much larger than in functional activation, resulting in the failure of the Beer-Lambert approximation to yield accurate results. We describe the use of simultaneous LSF and MSRI, using a nonlinear Monte Carlo fitting technique, to record rapid changes in CBF, HbO, HbR, and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) during acute focal cerebral ischemia induced by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) and reperfusion. This technique captures CBF and CMRO(2) changes during hemodynamic and metabolic events with high temporal and spatial resolution through the intact skull and demonstrates the utility of simultaneous LSF and MSRI in mouse models of cerebrovascular disease.},

abstract = {Significance: Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is frequently used to assess oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration in living tissue. Methods solving the inverse problem may include time-consuming nonlinear optimization or artificial neural networks (ANN) determining the absorption coefficient one wavelength at a time.
Aim: To present an ANN-based method that directly outputs the oxygen saturation and the hemoglobin concentration using the shape of the measured spectra as input.
Approach: A probe-based DRS setup with dual source-detector separations in the visible wavelength range was used. ANNs were trained on spectra generated from a three-layer tissue model with oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration as target.
Results: Modeled evaluation data with realistic measurement noise showed an absolute root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of 5.1{\%} units for oxygen saturation estimation. The relative RMS deviation for hemoglobin concentration was 13{\%}. This accuracy is at least twice as good as our previous nonlinear optimization method. On blood-intralipid phantoms, the RMS deviation from the oxygen saturation derived from partial oxygen pressure measurements was 5.3{\%} and 1.6{\%} in two separate measurement series. Results during brachial occlusion showed expected patterns.
Conclusions: The presented method, directly assessing oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration, is fast, accurate, and robust to noise.},

However, while its potential to aid surgical decision-making has been investigated for a range of applications, to date no real-time intraoperative HSI (iHSI) system has been presented that follows critical design considerations to ensure a satisfactory integration into the surgical workflow. By establishing functional and technical requirements of an intraoperative system for surgery, we present an iHSI system design that allows for real-time wide-field HSI and responsive surgical guidance in a highly constrained operating theatre. Two systems exploiting state-of-the-art industrial HSI cameras, respectively using linescan and snapshot imaging technology, were designed and investigated by performing assessments against established design criteria and ex vivo tissue experiments. Finally, we report the use of our real-time iHSI system in a clinical feasibility case study as part of a spinal fusion surgery.

abstract = {The brain and spinal cord are enveloped within three layers of membrane collectively known as the meninges, with the cranial meninges specifically referring to the section that covers the brain. From superficial to deep, the three layers are the dura, arachnoid, and pia—the term “mater,” Latin for mother, often follows these names (i.e., dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater).[1] The dura, Latin for “hard,” is composed of dense connective tissue and adheres to the inner surface of the skull and vertebrae. The arachnoid is a thin wispy membrane that lies just deep to the dura and is superficial to the pia, the very thin, clear membrane that directly adheres to the surface of the brain and spinal cord. Forming from these layers are three clinically significant spaces, or potential spaces (sometimes called cavities): the epidural, subdural and subarachnoid spaces, from superficial to deep. The chief function of the meninges is to protect the contents of the brain and spinal cord.[2]},

Here, an effective multiplex immunochromatographic platform (MICP) with synthesis-free and cost-effective merits is established for simultaneous detection of antibiotics on a single immunochromatographic assay (ICA) strip. Adopting crystal violet (CV) as a signal tag for multiplex ICA allows for direct coupling with multiple antibodies in several minutes. By combining CV and ICA perfectly, this convenient strategy offers improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability, eventually ensuring the optimized effectiveness of this approach. As a result, the established platform is successfully used to detect streptomycin (STR) and chloramphenicol (CAP) with visual detection mode, and the obtained total recoveries of milk and honey real samples changed from 83.82 to 113.38{\%} with total RSD values of 0.48 to 4.15{\%}.},

abstract = {Maximal safe resection is the mainstay of treatment in the neurosurgical management of gliomas, and preserving functional integrity is linked to favorable outcomes. How these modalities differ in their effectiveness on the extent of resection (EOR), survival, and complications remains unknown. A systematic literature search was performed with the following inclusion criteria: published between 2005 and 2022, involving brain glioma surgery, and including one or a combination of intraoperative modalities: intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI), awake/general anesthesia craniotomy mapping (AC/GA), fluorescence-guided imaging, or combined modalities. Of 525 articles, 464 were excluded and 61 articles were included, involving 5221 glioma patients, 7(11.4{\%}) articles used iMRI, 21(36.8{\%}) used cortical mapping, 15(24.5{\%}) used 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) or fluorescein sodium, and 18(29.5{\%}) used combined modalities. The heterogeneity in reporting the amount of surgical resection prevented further analysis. Progression-free survival/overall survival (PFS/OS) were reported in 18/61(29.5{\%}) articles, while complications and permanent disability were reported in 38/61(62.2{\%}) articles. The reviewed studies demonstrate that intraoperative adjuncts such as iMRI, AC/GA mapping, fluorescence-guided imaging, and a combination of these modalities improve EOR. However, PFS/OS were underreported. Combining multiple intraoperative modalities seems to have the highest effect compared to each adjunct alone.},

Beside conventional wound treatment, for instance kinds of oxygen therapy and cold plasma technology have been tested, providing an improvement in the perfusion of wounds and their healing potential, but these methods are unfortunately not sufficiently validated and accepted for clinical practice to date. Using hyperspectral imaging technology in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region with high spectral and spatial resolution, perfusion parameters of tissue and wounds can be determined. We present a new compact hyperspectral camera which can be used in clinical practice. From hyperspectral data the hemoglobin oxygenation (StO2), the relative concentration of hemoglobin [tissue hemoglobin index (THI)] and the so-called NIR-perfusion index can be determined. The first two parameters are calculated from the VIS-part of the spectrum and represent the perfusion of superficial tissue layers, whereas the NIR-perfusion index is calculated from the NIR-part representing the perfusion in deeper layers. First clinical measurements of transplanted flaps and chronic ulcer wounds show, that the perfusion level can be determined quantitatively allowing sensitive evaluation and monitoring for an optimization of the wound treatment planning and for validation of new treatment methods.},

abstract = {The calibration of optical tissue-simulating phantoms remains an open question in spite of the many techniques proposed for accurate measurements of optical properties. As a consequence, a reference phantom with well known optical properties is still missing. As a first step towards a reference phantom we have recently proposed to use dilutions of Intralipid 20{\%}. In this paper we discuss a matter that is commonly ignored when dilutions are prepared, i.e., the possibility of deviations from the simple linear relationships between the optical properties of the dilution and the Intralipid concentration due to the effects of dependent scattering. The results of an experimental investigation showed that dependent scattering does not affect absorption. As for the reduced scattering coefficient the effect can be described adding a term proportional to the square of the concentration. However, for concentrations of interest for tissue optics deviations from linearity remain within about 2{\%}. The experimental investigation also showed that the microphysical properties of Intralipid are not affected by dilution. These results show the possibility to easily obtain a liquid diffusive phantom whose optical properties are known with error smaller than about 1{\%}. Due to the intrinsic limitations of the different techniques proposed for measuring the optical properties it seems difficult to obtain a similar accuracy for solid phantoms.},

abstract = {Management of acute brain injury is based on a central concept that prevention of secondary hypoxic/ischaemic injury is associated with improved outcomes. While clinical assessment of neurological state remains fundamental to neuromonitoring, several techniques are available for global and regional brain monitoring that provide assessment of cerebral perfusion, oxygenation and metabolic status, and early warning of impending brain hypoxia/ischaemia. Developments in multimodality monitoring have enabled an individually tailored approach to patient management in which treatment decisions are guided by monitored changes in physiological variables rather than pre-defined, generic thresholds. Any impact of monitor-guided therapy on outcomes is entirely dependent on the threshold to initiate intervention and subsequent management in response to change in a particular monitored variable, and these remain undefined in many circumstances. This article describes current neuromonitoring techniques used during the critical care management of acute brain injury. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Oximetry is a technique for the assessment of blood oxygenation by measurements of light transmission through the blood, which is based on the different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood provides information on the adequacy of respiration and is routinely measured in clinical settings, utilizing pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation, in venous blood (SvO2) and in the entire blood in a tissue (StO2), is related to the blood supply to the tissue, and several oximetric techniques have been developed for their assessment. SvO2 can be measured non‐invasively in the fingers, making use of modified pulse oximetry, and in the retina, using the modified Beer–Lambert Law. StO2 is measured in peripheral muscle and cerebral tissue by means of various modes of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), utilizing the relative transparency of infrared light in muscle and cerebral tissue. The primary problem of oximetry is the discrimination between absorption by hemoglobin and scattering by tissue elements in the attenuation measurement, and the various techniques developed for isolating the absorption effect are presented in the current review, with their limitations.},

Generating realistic RGB images using HSI is seldom the main focus of remote sensing researchers, and is therefore sometimes lacking. In this paper, we present an algorithm which creates realistic color images of HSI, using standardized methods. Research, conducted on the human perception of color in the 1920s culminated in the CIE 1931 XYZ color space. The algorithm maps every spectral band in the visible spectrum to the XYZ color space, using D65 as the reference illuminant, and then maps the XYZ to the sRGB (standard Red Green Blue) color space. The image is gamma-corrected and finally thresholded to improve contrast. The method was validated using two HSIs, creating realistic color images.},

abstract = {The paper aims at explaining the usage of SAM algorithm for satellite image classification. Hyperspectral Image provides pixel spectrum that fetches detailed information about a surface to identify and distinguish between spectrally similar (but unique) materials. The Hyperspectral Image sensor placed on board the Remote Sensing Satellite captures Hyperspectral Images with various bands of spectrum. Experiments are carried out for the implementation of Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) on Hyper-spectral Images for classification of pixels on the surface. The false color composite of the image is also obtained for better visualization of surface differences. The Hyperspectral Images of various bands are stacked one after the other to form three-dimensional Cube of images for SAM implementation. SAM is a supervised classification algorithm which identifies the various classes in the image based on the calculation of the spectral angle. The spectral angle is calculated between the test vector built for each pixel and the reference vector built for each reference classes selected by the user. Results are obtained to read and reorganize multiple 2-D datasets into a single compact 3D dataset cube. The reference vector is built for performing SAM classification and the angle between the reference vector and pixel vector is calculated to compare with the determined threshold angle value. The color coding is then applied to distinguish between the various classes that have been recognized by the SAM algorithm. Hence using SAM, Hyperspectral images are analyzed to extract thematic information such as land-cover, water bodies, and clouds.},

Our results stress the importance of considering the mouse strain and gender when planning pre-clinical experiments that depend on light-skin interactions. Here, we evaluated the optical properties of depilated albino and pigmented mouse skin using reproducible methods to determine parameters that have wide applicability in biomedical optics. Light penetration depth ($\delta$), absorption ($\mu$a), reduced scattering ($\mu$′s) and reduced attenuation ($\mu$′t) coefficients were calculated using the Kubelka-Munk model of photon transport and spectrophotometric measurements. Within a broad wavelength coverage (400-1400 nm), the main optical tissue interactions of visible and near infrared radiation could be inferred. Histological analysis was performed to correlate the findings with tissue composition and structure. Disperse melanin granules present in depilated pigmented mouse skin were shown to be irrelevant for light absorption. Gender mostly affected optical properties in the visible range due to variations in blood and abundance of dense connective tissue. On the other hand, mouse strains could produce more variations in the hydration level of skin, leading to changes in absorption in the infrared spectral region. A spectral region of minimal light attenuation, commonly referred as the "optical window", was observed between 600 and 1350 nm.},

abstract = {Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sensors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013–2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation.},

The models predict the diffuse reflectance of both (i) semi-infinite homogeneous and (ii) two-layer media exposed to normal and collimated light. The two-layer medium consisted of a plane-parallel slab of finite thickness over a semi-infinite layer with identical index of refraction but different absorption and scattering properties. The model accounted for absorption and anisotropic scattering, as well as for internal reflection at the medium/air interface. All media were assumed to be nonemitting, strongly forward scattering, with indices of refraction between 1.00 and 1.44 and transport single-scattering albedos between 0.50 and 0.99. First, simple analytical expressions for the diffuse reflectance of the semi-infinite and two-layer media considered were derived using the two-flux approximation. Then, parameters appearing in the analytical expression previously derived were instead fittedtomatch results from more accurate Monte Carlo simulations. A single semiempirical parameter was sufficient to relate the diffuse reflectance to the radiative properties and thickness of the semi-infinite and two-layer media. The present model can be used for a wide range of applications including noninvasive diagnosis of biological tissue. copy; 2009 Optical Society of America.},

@article{Anderson1981,
abstract = {An integrated review of the transfer of optical radiation into human skin is presented, aimed at developing useful models for photomedicine. The component chromophores of epidermis and stratum corneum in general determine the attenuation of radiation in these layers, moreso than does optical scattering. Epidermal thickness and melanization are important factors for UV wavelengths less than 300 nm, whereas the attenuation of UVA (320-400 nm) and visible radiation is primarily via melanin. The selective penetration of all optical wavelengths into psoriatic skin can be maximized by application of clear lipophilic liquids, which decrease regular reflectance by a refractive-index matching mechanism. Sensitivity to wavelengths less than 320 nm can be enhanced by prolonged aqueous bathing, which extracts urocanic acid and other diffusible epidermal chromophores. Optical properties of the dermis are modelled using the Kubelka-Munk approach, and calculations of scattering and absorption coefficients are presented. This simple approach allows estimates of the penetration of radiation in vivo using noninvasive measurements of cutaneous spectral remittance (diffuse reflectance). Although the blood chromophores Hb, HbO2, and bilirubin determine dermal absorption of wavelengths longer than 320 nm, scattering by collagen fibers largely determines the depths to which these wavelengths penetrate the dermis, and profoundly modifies skin colors. An optical indowexists between 600 and 1300 nm, which offers the possibility of treating large tissue volumes with certain long-wavelength photosensitizers. Moreover, whenever photosensitized action spectra extend across the near UV and/or visible spectrum, judicious choice of wavelength allows some selection of the tissue layers directly affected.},

abstract = {The main goal of brain cancer surgery is to perform an accurate resection of the tumor, preserving as much normal brain tissue as possible for the patient. The development of a non-contact and label-free method to provide reliable support for tumor resection in real-time during neurosurgical procedures is a current clinical need. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free imaging modality that can assist surgeons during this challenging task without using any contrast agent. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for processing hyperspectral images of in vivo human brain tissue. The proposed framework was evaluated by our human image database, which includes 26 in vivo hyperspectral cubes from 16 different patients, among which 258,810 pixels were labeled. The proposed framework is able to generate a thematic map where the parenchymal area of the brain is delineated and the location of the tumor is identified, providing guidance to the operating surgeon for a successful and precise tumor resection. The deep learning pipeline achieves an overall accuracy of 80{\%} for multiclass classification, improving the results obtained with traditional support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches. In addition, an aid visualization system is presented, where the final thematic map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the optimal classification threshold for the current situation during the surgical procedure.},

abstract = {Surgery for gliomas (intrinsic brain tumors), especially when low-grade, is challenging due to the infiltrative nature of the lesion. Currently, no real-time, intra-operative, label-free and wide-field tool is available to assist and guide the surgeon to find the relevant demarcations for these tumors. While marker-based methods exist for the high-grade glioma case, there is no convenient solution available for the low-grade case; thus, marker-free optical techniques represent an attractive option. Although RGB imaging is a standard tool in surgical microscopes, it does not contain sufficient information for tissue differentiation. We leverage the richer information from hyperspectral imaging (HSI), acquired with a snapscan camera in the 468-787 nm range, coupled to a surgical microscope, to build a deep-learning-based diagnostic tool for cancer resection with potential for intra-operative guidance. However, the main limitation of the HSI snapscan camera is the image acquisition time, limiting its widespread deployment in the operation theater. Here, we investigate the effect of HSI channel reduction and pre-selection to scope the design space for the development of cheaper and faster sensors. Neural networks are used to identify the most important spectral channels for tumor tissue differentiation, optimizing the trade-off between the number of channels and precision to enable real-time intra-surgical application. We evaluate the performance of our method on a clinical dataset that was acquired during surgery on five patients. By demonstrating the possibility to efficiently detect low-grade glioma, these results can lead to better cancer resection demarcations, potentially improving treatment effectiveness and patient outcome.},

The content of biological chromophores and scattering features were estimated by fitting a model derived from diffusion theory to the DRS spectra. DRS parameters differed significantly between tumor and normal brain tissue. Classification using random forest yielded a sensitivity and specificity for the detection of low-grade gliomas of 82.0{\%} and 82.7{\%}, respectively, and the area under curve (AUC) was 0.91.

To address this, we fit the probe with an optical device that images the illumination and collection fibers onto the tissue surface, eliminating the influence of contact probe pressure on the sampling area. The noncontact probe addition addresses new optical conditions that may affect its performance such as tissue surface contour, and specular reflections by implementing an autofocusing mechanism and cross polarization. Extracted optical properties of tissue simulating phantoms yield errors of 3.46{\%} in reduced scattering and 8.62{\%} in absorbance.

abstract = {Background: Postoperative three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (3DDSA) is the gold standard in evaluating intracranial aneurysm (IA) remnants after clipping. Should intraoperative 3D-DSA image quality be equally good as postoperative 3D-DSA, it could supplant the latter as standard of care for follow-up of clipped IA. Objective: To directly compare the quality of assessment of clipped IA by intraoperative and postoperative 3D-DSA. Methods: From a prospective cohort of 221 consecutive patients who underwent craniotomy for IA treatment in a hybrid operating room, we retrospectively studied 26 patients who had both intraoperative and postoperative 3D-DSA imaging of their clipped aneurysm. Comparison of intraoperative and postoperative 3D-DSA images (blinded for review) included parameters that affected image quality and differences between the 2 periods. Results: In the 26 patients with 32 clipped IAs, the mean interval was 11 ± 7 mo between intraoperative and postoperative imaging 3D-DSA examinations. Reconstruction with multiple clips was used in 14 (44{\%}) cases. Of 15 remnants, 9 (60{\%}) were small ({\textless}2 mm). In comparing intraoperative and postoperative 3D-DSA, no discordance or discrepancy in assessment of the surgical result was noted for any clipped IA, and overall imaging quality was excellent for both modalities. Factors affecting minor differences in image qualitywere not identified. Conclusion: Compared with postoperative 3D-DSA, intraoperative 3D-DSA images achieved equally high quality and effective, immediate interpretation of the surgical clipping result. With comparable imaging quality and no discordant findings, intraoperative 3D-DSA could replace postoperative 3D-DSA to become the standard of care in IA surgery.},

This review reflects on the journey, from the nascent concept of a standardised system to detect acute illness severity and clinical deterioration through to the adoption of NEWS2 by the NHS and, ultimately, its incorporation into quality indicators of acute care provision. The impact of NEWS/NEWS2 on the transformation of provision and configuration and training of acute care teams in hospitals is reviewed. User feedback has been key in iterating guidance on the use of NEWS/NEWS2 and key elements of this are discussed. The ultimate aim of NEWS was to improve patient outcomes with acute illness or deterioration and the impact on outcomes is now becoming apparent but, paradoxically, an effective response can eliminate the link between the score and the ultimate outcome. This review concludes with a reflection on what the next 10 years may bring, particularly with the digital transformation of healthcare and its potential impact on scoring systems, as well as the necessary permeation of NEWS2 beyond the acute hospital setting into emergency response triage in primary and community care settings.

Ten years on, via NEWS/NEWS2, the NHS is the first healthcare system globally with a ‘common language' of illness severity and a standardised early warning system for acute clinical illness and deterioration, a system that is now being replicated in many other areas of the world.},

abstract = {Significance: The estimation of tissue oxygenation is vital in the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of a huge assortment of diseases. The hyperspectral (HS) imaging system is a rising innovation that can be utilized to build a highly sensitive, non-invasive, and tissue hemoglobin immersion map. Objective: As a result of the urgent need to design and implement early detection devices and applications for the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose building a non-invasive custom optical imaging system to assist with phlebotomy and vascular approach to survey the reliability of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels recovered from spectral images. Materials and Methods: HS images were gathered from 15 healthy subjects without previous medical history complications and with an average age range of 20 to 38 years, who were undergoing phlebotomy. The forearm was vigorously illuminated utilizing an HS camera with polychromatic source light of spectrum range (400∼980 nm). Spectroscopic reflectance images were caught by a focal plane exhibit for the region of interest (ROI). Then the custom algorithm comprising normalization and moving average filtering for noise removal was applied, followed by K-mean clustering for image segmentation to visualize and highlight the arteries and the veins in the investigated forearm. Results: The investigations show that after normalization of the recorded signal from the HS camera of the participating subjects it was noticed that at wavelength of 460 nm the oxygenated arteries had a stronger signal than the de-oxygenated veins, and at a wavelength of 750 nm the de-oxygenated veins had a stronger signal than the oxygenated arteries. Thus, the ideal wavelength to reveal the oxygenated arteries was 460 nm, and the ideal wavelength to reveal the de-oxygenated veins was 750 nm. Conclusions: HSI is a prospective technique to assist with phlebotomy and non-contact oxygen saturation approach. Additionally, it may permit future surgical or pharmacological intercessions that titrate or limit ischemic injury continuously.},

We conducted a systematic review of surgical in vivo label-free multispectral and HSI systems that have been assessed intraoperatively in adult patients, published over a 10-year period to May 2018. We analysed 14 studies including 8 different HSI systems. Current in-vivo HSI systems generate an intraoperative tissue oxygenation map or enable tumour detection. Intraoperative tissue oxygenation measurements may help to predict those patients at risk of postoperative complications and in-vivo intraoperative tissue characterization may be performed with high specificity and sensitivity. All systems utilized a line-scanning or wavelength-scanning method but the spectral range and number of spectral bands employed varied significantly between studies and according to the system's clinical aim. The time to acquire a hyperspectral cube dataset ranged between 5 and 30 seconds. No safety concerns were reported in any studies. A small number of studies have demonstrated the capabilities of intraoperative in-vivo label-free HSI but further work is needed to fully integrate it into the current surgical workflow.},

Multispectral spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is an emerging imaging technique that has been widely used to quantify tissue perfusion properties. However, slow processing speed limits its usefulness in real-time imaging applications. In this study, we present a two-stage lookup table (LUT) approach that accurately and rapidly quantifies optical (absorption and reduced scattering maps) and perfusion (total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation maps) properties using stage-1 and stage-2 LUTs, respectively, based on reflectance images at 660 and 850 nm. The two-stage LUT can be implemented on both CPU and GPU computing platforms. Quantifying tissue perfusion properties using the simulated diffuse reflectance images, we achieved a quantification speed of 266, 174, and 74 frames per second for three image sizes 512 × 512, 1024 × 1024, and 2048 × 2048 pixels, respectively. Quantification of tissue perfusion properties was highly accurate with only 3.5{\%} and 2.5{\%} error for total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation quantification, respectively. The two-stage LUT has the potential to be integrated with dual-sensor cameras to enable real-time quantification of tissue hemodynamics.},

@article{Fercher2003,
abstract = {There have been three basic approaches to optical tomography since the early 1980s: diffraction tomography, diffuse optical tomography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Optical techniques are of particular importance in the medical field, because these techniques promise to be safe and cheap and, in addition, offer a therapeutic potential. Advances in OCT technology have made it possible to apply OCT in a wide variety of applications but medical applications are still dominating. Specific advantages of OCT are its high depth and transversal resolution, the fact, that its depth resolution is decoupled from transverse resolution, high probing depth in scattering media, contact-free and non-invasive operation, and the possibility to create various function dependent image contrasting methods. This report presents the principles of OCT and the state of important OCT applications. OCT synthesises cross-sectional images from a series of laterally adjacent depth-scans. At present OCT is used in three different fields of optical imaging, in macroscopic imaging of structures which can be seen by the naked eye or using weak magnifications, in microscopic imaging using magnifications up to the classical limit of microscopic resolution and in endoscopic imaging, using low and medium magnification. First, OCT techniques, like the reflectometry technique and the dual beam technique were based on time-domain low coherence interferometry depth-scans. Later, Fourier-domain techniques have been developed and led to new imaging schemes. Recently developed parallel OCT schemes eliminate the need for lateral scanning and, therefore, dramatically increase the imaging rate. These schemes use CCD cameras and CMOS detector arrays as photodetectors. Video-rate three-dimensional OCT pictures have been obtained. Modifying interference microscopy techniques has led to high-resolution optical coherence microscopy that achieved sub-micrometre resolution. This report is concluded with a short presentation of important OCT applications. Ophthalmology is, due to the transparent ocular structures, still the main field of OCT application. The first commercial instrument too has been introduced for ophthalmic diagnostics (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Advances in using near-infrared light, however, opened the path for OCT imaging in strongly scattering tissues. Today, optical in vivo biopsy is one of the most challenging fields of OCT application. High resolution, high penetration depth, and its potential for functional imaging attribute to OCT an optical biopsy quality, which can be used to assess tissue and cell function and morphology in situ. OCT can already clarify the relevant architectural tissue morphology. For many diseases, however, including cancer in its early stages, higher resolution is necessary. New broad-bandwidth light sources, like photonic crystal fibres and superfluorescent fibre sources, and new contrasting techniques, give access to new sample properties and unmatched sensitivity and resolution.},

abstract = {In both photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasonic (US) imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. Consequently, with the increased use of combined PA and US (PAUS) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. To this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. Forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, Intralipid({\textregistered}) 20{\%} IV fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while India Ink, Direct Red 81, and Evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. The following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 MHz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 MHz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). Results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. Based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. Thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of PAUS imaging studies.},

Three analytical optical reflectance models for homogeneous, semi-infinite, tissue have been proposed (Modified Beer-Lambert, Jacques 1999, Yudovsky 2009) but these have not been directly compared for tissue parameter extraction purposes. We compare these analytical models using Monte Carlo simulated diffuse reflectance spectra and controlled gelatin-based phantoms with measured diffuse reflectance spectra and known ground truth composition parameters. The Yudovsky model performed best against Monte Carlo simulations and measured spectra of tissue phantoms in terms of goodness of fit and parameter extraction accuracy followed closely by Jacques' model. In this study, Yudovsky's model appeared most robust, however our results demonstrated that both Yudovsky and Jacques models are suitable for modelling tissue that can be approximated as a single, homogeneous, semi-infinite slab.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 20{\%} of low-grade gliomas (LGG) display visible protoporphyrin fluorescence during surgery after 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) administration. OBJECTIVE: To determine if fluorescence represents a prognostic marker in LGG. METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients with LGG (World Health Organization 2016) were operated on with 5-ALA. Fluorescent tissue was specifically biopsied. Tumor size, age, Karnofsky index, contrast-enhancement, fluorescence, and molecular factors (IDH1/IDH2-mutations, Ki67/MIB1 Index, 1p19q codeletions, ATRX, EGFR, p53 expression, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promotor methylation), were related to progression-free survival (PFS), malignant transformation-free survival (MTFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Sixteen of seventy-four LGGs (21.6{\%}) fluoresced. Fluorescence was partially related to weak enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging and increased (positron emission tomography)PET-FET uptake, but not to Karnofsky Performance Score, tumor size, or age. Regarding molecular markers, only EGFR expression differed marginally (fluorescing vs nonfluorescing: 19{\%} vs 5{\%}; P =. 057). Median follow-up was 46.4 mo (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 41.8-51.1). PFS, MTFS, and OS were shorter in fluorescing tumors (PFS: median 9.8 mo, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-27.7 vs 45.8, 31.9-59.7, MTFS: 43.0 [27.5-58.5] vs 64.6 [57.7-71.5], median not reached, P =. 015; OS: 51.6, [34.8-68.3] vs [68.2, 62.7-73.8], P =. 002). IDH mutations significantly predicted PFS, MTFS, and OS. In multivariate analysis IDH status and fluorescence both independently predicted MTFS and OS. PFS was not independently predicted by fluorescence. CONCLUSION: This is the first report investigating the role of ALA-induced fluorescence in histologically confirmed LGG. Fluorescence appeared to be a marker for inherent malignant transformation and OS, independently of known prognostic markers. Fluorescence in LGG might be taken into account when deciding on adjuvant therapies.},

abstract = {Significance: Physiological parameters extracted from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) provide clinicians quantitative information about tissue that helps aid in diagnosis. There is a great need for an accurate and cost-effective method for extracting parameters from DRS measurements. Aim: The aim is to explore the accuracy and speed of physiological parameter extraction using machine learning models compared to that of the widely used Monte Carlo lookup table (MCLUT) inverse model. Approach: Diffuse reflectance spectra were simulated using a light transport model based on Monte Carlo simulations and weighted to six wavelengths. Deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and generalized linear model (GLM) machine learning models were built using a training set of 10,000 spectra from the simulated data. The MCLUT and machine learning models were used to predict physiological parameters from a separate test set of 30,000 simulated spectra. Mean absolute errors were calculated to evaluate the accuracy and compare it among MCLUT and machine learning models. In addition, the computational time to predict parameters from the test set was recorded to compare the speed among MCLUT and machine learning models. Results: The DL, RF, GBM, and GLM models all had significantly lower errors than the MCLUT inverse method for six wavelengths. The DL model proved to have the lowest errors, with all absolute percent errors under 10{\%}. The DL model had much faster runtimes than the MCLUT. Conclusions: Machine learning is promising for extracting physiological parameters from six-wavelength DRS data, with both lower errors and a faster runtime than the widely used MCLUT model.},

An anti-vignetting method is concerned with the estimation of a correction factor at each pixel position. In this paper, we propose two anti-vignetting methods which effectively estimate the distribution of correction factors. The first method utilizes wavelet-based denoising for efficient suppression of input image noise. Decimation of the smoothed distribution of correction factors is then carried out. The second method is more concerned with the appropriateness for embedded digital imaging applications. We approximate the distribution of correction factors by a single correction function, which is in the form of a 2-D hypercosine function. Only five parameters are needed to describe an underlying input intensity distribution and are estimated by nonlinear model fitting against measured input illumination data. We show the performance of the proposed methods by experimental results using synthetic and real images. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

The system is validated on liquid optical phantoms mimicking brain tissue haemodynamics and metabolism, and finally applied in vivo on the exposed cortex of mice undergoing alternating oxygenation challenges. The results of the study demonstrate the capacity of hNIR to map and quantify the haemodynamic and metabolic states of the exposed cortex at microvascular levels.

Near-infrared hyperspectral images of milk powder, rice flour and soybean flour were acquired and denoising in the spectral domain were studied. Noise free spectra and noises were simulated based on sample pixel-wise spectra. The noisy spectra with signal to noise ratio (SNR) around 45 ​dB (similar to real pixel-wise spectra) were simulated. The simulated noisy spectra were preprocessed by traditional methods as moving average smoothing (MAS), Savitzky-Golay smoothing (SGS), wavelet transform (WT) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The basic denoising autoencoder (DAE-1) and the stacked DAE (DAE-2) were studied for denoising. The noisy spectra with SNR around 35 ​dB and 55 ​dB were further simulated to explore the effectiveness of DAE based methods. DAE-1 and DAE-2 performed better than the other methods, with higher SNR, lower mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The developed DAE methods were applied to real-world pixel-wise spectra with good performances. The overall results proved the feasibility of using DAE based methods for noise reduction in the spectral domain of hyperspectral images, and the DAE based methods have great potential to be extended to spectral denoising of other vibrational spectroscopy techniques.},

Multispectral imaging is used to achieve better discrimination between the radiance spectra, as compared to the color images. However, it is still sensitive to illumination changes. This study evaluates the potential evolution of illuminant estimation models from color to multispectral imaging. We first present a state of the art on computational color constancy and then extend a set of algorithms to use them in multispectral imaging. We investigate the influence of camera spectral sensitivities and the number of channels. Experiments are performed on simulations over hyperspectral data. The outcomes indicate that extension of computational color constancy algorithms from color to spectral gives promising results and may have the potential to lead towards efficient and stable representation across illuminants. However, this is highly dependent on spectral sensitivities and noise. We believe that the development of illuminant invariant multispectral imaging systems will be a key enabler for further use of this technology.},

abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an optical technique based on inelastic scattering of light by vibrating molecules and can provide chemical fingerprints of cells, tissues or biofluids. The high chemical specificity, minimal or lack of sample preparation and the ability to use advanced optical technologies in the visible or near-infrared spectral range (lasers, microscopes, fibre-optics) have recently led to an increase in medical diagnostic applications of Raman spectroscopy. The key hypothesis underpinning this field is that molecular changes in cells, tissues or biofluids, that are either the cause or the effect of diseases, can be detected and quantified by Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, multivariate calibration and classification models based on Raman spectra can be developed on large "training" datasets and used subsequently on samples from new patients to obtain quantitative and objective diagnosis. Historically, spontaneous Raman spectroscopy has been known as a low signal technique requiring relatively long acquisition times. Nevertheless, new strategies have been developed recently to overcome these issues: non-linear optical effects and metallic nanoparticles can be used to enhance the Raman signals, optimised fibre-optic Raman probes can be used for real-time in-vivo single-point measurements, while multimodal integration with other optical techniques can guide the Raman measurements to increase the acquisition speed and spatial accuracy of diagnosis. These recent efforts have advanced Raman spectroscopy to the point where the diagnostic accuracy and speed are compatible with clinical use. This paper reviews the main Raman spectroscopy techniques used in medical diagnostics and provides an overview of various applications.},

abstract = {Optically monitoring the vascular physiology during photodynamic therapy (PDT) may help understand patient-specific treatment outcome. However, diffuse optical techniques have failed to observe changes herein, probably by optically sampling too deep. Therefore, we investigated using differential path-length spectroscopy (DPS) to obtain superficial measurements of vascular physiology in actinic keratosis (AK) skin. The AK-specific DPS interrogation depth was chosen up to 400 microns in depth, based on the thickness of AK histology samples. During light fractionated aminolevulinic acid-PDT, reflectance spectra were analyzed to yield quantitative estimates of blood volume and saturation. Blood volume showed significant lesion-specific changes during PDT without a general trend for all lesions and saturation remained high during PDT. This study shows that DPS allows optically monitoring the superficial blood volume and saturation during skin PDT. The patient-specific variability supports the need for dosimetric measurements. In DPS, the lesion-specific optimal interrogation depth can be varied based on lesion thickness. {\textcopyright} 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

Hardware limitations of current optical systems used for handheld real-time video HSI result in a limited focal depth, thereby posing usability issues for integration of the technology into the operating room. This work integrates a focus-tunable liquid lens into a video HSI exoscope, and proposes novel video autofocusing methods based on deep reinforcement learning. A first-of-its-kind robotic focal-time scan was performed to create a realistic and reproducible testing dataset. We benchmarked our proposed autofocus algorithm against traditional policies, and found our novel approach to perform significantly (p{\textless} 0.05 ) better than traditional techniques (0.070 ±. 098 mean absolute focal error compared to 0.146 ±. 148 ). In addition, we performed a blinded usability trial by having two neurosurgeons compare the system with different autofocus policies, and found our novel approach to be the most favourable, making our system a desirable addition for intraoperative HSI.},

abstract = {During the last 10 years, microscope-integrated indocyanine green fluorescence (m-ICG) has been widely used for assessing real-time blood flow during aneurysm surgery. More recently, an endoscope-integrated indocyanine green fluorescence (e-ICG) has been adopted as a versatile tool during different endoscopic neurosurgical procedures. The purpose of the present report is to evaluate multimodal applications of e-ICG during different endonasal, intraventricular, aneurysm and brain tumor surgeries and provide technical nuances. In addition, we reviewed the literature and identified and compare several overlapping case series of patients treated via an endoscopic integrated indocyanine green fluorescence technique. A total of 40 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into four main groups: (1) endoscopic endonasal approaches (n = 14); (2) ventricular endoscopic approach including patients undergoing third ventriculostomy (n = 8) and tumor biopsy (n = 1); (3) aneurysms surgery (n = 9); and (4) brain parenchymal tumors (n = 8). All patients were successfully treated using the e-ICG dynamic endoscopic visualization, and there were no perioperative complications. Such unique features open up a promising field of applications beyond the use of m-ICG in different surgical field due to the longer duration of e-ICG fluorescence up to 35 ± 7 min. E-ICG represents a new and effective technique for longer real-time visualization of vascular structures preserving normal tissues and functions during different transcranial and endonasal approaches. As the technology and e-ICG resolution improves, the technique has the potential to become a critical tool for different applications in neurosurgery.},

abstract = {Significance: Confocal laser scanning enables optical sectioning in clinical fiber bundle endomicroscopes, but lower-cost, simplified endomicroscopes use widefield incoherent illumination instead. Optical sectioning can be introduced in these simple systems using structured illumination microscopy (SIM), a multiframe digital subtraction process. However, SIM results in artifacts when the probe is in motion, making the technique difficult to use in vivo and preventing the use of mosaicking to synthesize a larger effective field of view (FOV).
Aim: We report and validate an automatic motion compensation technique to overcome motion artifacts and allow generation of mosaics in SIM endomicroscopy.
Approach: Motion compensation is achieved using image registration and real-time pattern orientation correction via a digital micromirror device. We quantify the similarity of moving probe reconstructions to those acquired with a stationary probe using the relative mean of the absolute differences (MAD). We further demonstrate mosaicking with a moving probe in mechanical and freehand operation.
Results: Reconstructed SIM images show an improvement in the MAD from 0.85 to 0.13 for lens paper and from 0.27 to 0.12 for bovine tissue. Mosaics also show vastly reduced artifacts.
Conclusion: The reduction in motion artifacts in individual SIM reconstructions leads to mosaics that more faithfully represent the morphology of tissue, giving clinicians a larger effective FOV than the probe itself can provide.},

abstract = {Purpose: Complete tumor removal during cancer surgery remains challenging due to the lack of accurate techniques for intraoperative margin assessment. This study evaluates the use of hyperspectral imaging for margin assessment by reporting its use in fresh human breast specimens. Experimental Design: Hyperspectral data were first acquired on tissue slices from 18 patients after gross sectioning of the resected breast specimen. This dataset, which contained over 22,000 spectra, was well correlated with histopathology and was used to develop a support vector machine classification algorithm and test the classification performance. In addition, we evaluated hyperspectral imaging in clinical practice by imaging the resection surface of six lumpectomy specimens. With the developed classification algorithm, we determined if hyperspectral imaging could detect malignancies in the resection surface. Results: The diagnostic performance of hyperspectral imaging on the tissue slices was high; invasive carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, connective tissue, and adipose tissue were correctly classified as tumor or healthy tissue with accuracies of 93{\%}, 84{\%}, 70{\%}, and 99{\%}, respectively. These accuracies increased with the size of the area, consisting of one tissue type. The entire resection surface was imaged within 10 minutes, and data analysis was performed fast, without the need of an experienced operator. On the resection surface, hyperspectral imaging detected 19 of 20 malignancies that, according to the available histopathology information, were located within 2 mm of the resection surface. Conclusions: These findings show the potential of using hyperspectral imaging for margin assessment during breastconserving surgery to improve surgical outcome.},

This Letter shows how a relatively simple measurement technique can be used to form sharp images of the point spread function (PSF) in all bands, yielding information about spatial coregistration, as well as spatial resolution. A previously proposed metric is applied to characterize coregistration in terms of PSF similarity between bands. Resolution is characterized by ensquared energy. Two commercial hyperspectral cameras with nominally similar specifications are compared, and turn out to have large differences in their actual performance. The results, and the relative simplicity of the measurement, suggest that the method is suitable as a standardized performance test.},

Intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ) has potentially important applications in procedures such as organ transplantation or colorectal surgery, where successful reperfusion affects the viability and integrity of repaired tissues. In this paper a liquid crystal tuneable filter-based multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope is described. Motion-induced image misalignments are reduced, using feature-based registration, before regression of the tissue reflectance spectra to calculate relative quantities of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. The laparoscope was validated in vivo, during porcine abdominal surgery, by making parallel MSI and blood gas measurements of the small bowel vasculature. Ischaemic conditions were induced by local occlusion of the mesenteric arcade and monitored using the system. The MSI laparoscope was capable of measuring StO 2 over a wide range (30-100{\%}) with a temporal error of ± 7.5{\%}. The imager showed sensitivity to spatial changes in StO 2 during dynamic local occlusions, as well as tracking the recovery of tissues postocclusion.},

The operations of differentiation and filtering are especially important both as an end in themselves, and as a prelude to further treatment of the data. Numerical counterparts of analog devices that perform these operations, such as RC filters, are often considered. However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple. Two examples are presented as subroutines in the FORTRAN language. {\textcopyright} 1964, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases — consistently across modalities — with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

abstract = {Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is being used in exploratory clinical applications such as cancer margin assessment on excised tissue. However, when interrogating nonplanar tissue anomalies can arise from non-uniform pressure. Herein is reported the design, fabrication, and test of flexible, thin film silicon photodetectors (PDs) bonded to a flexible substrate designed for use in conformal DRS. The PDs have dark currents and responsivities comparable to conventional Si PDs, and were characterized while flat and while flexed at multiple radii of curvature using liquid phantoms mimicking adipose and malignant breast tissue. The DRS and nearest neighbor crosstalk results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations, showing good agreement between simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {Radiologically suspected low-grade gliomas (LGG) represent a special challenge for the neurosurgeon during surgery due to their histopathological heterogeneity and indefinite tumor margin. Therefore, new techniques are required to overcome these current surgical drawbacks. Intraoperative visualization of brain tumors with assistance of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence is one of the major advancements in the neurosurgical field in the last decades. Initially, this technique was exclusively applied for fluorescence-guided surgery of high-grade glioma (HGG). In the last years, the use of 5-ALA was also extended to other indications such as radiologically suspected LGG. Here, we discuss the current role of 5-ALA for intraoperative visualization of focal malignant transformation within suspected LGG. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations of the 5-ALA technology in pure LGG which usually cannot be visualized by visible fluorescence. Finally, we introduce new approaches based on fluorescence technology for improved detection of pure LGG tissue such as spectroscopic PpIX quantification fluorescence lifetime imaging of PpIX and confocal microscopy to optimize surgery.},

abstract = {In this study; an OCT-based intra-operative imaging method for blood flow detection during esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction is investigated. Change in perfusion of the gastric tube tissue can lead to ischemia; with a high morbidity and mortality as a result. Anastomotic leakage (incidence 5–20{\%}) is one of the most severe complications after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. Optical imaging techniques provide for minimal-invasive and real-time visualization tools that can be used in intraoperative settings. By implementing an optical technique for blood flow detection during surgery; perfusion can be imaged and quantified and; if needed; perfusion can be improved by either a surgical intervention or the administration of medication. The feasibility of imaging gastric microcirculation in vivo using optical coherence tomography (OCT) during surgery of patients with esophageal cancer by visualizing blood flow based on the speckle contrast from M-mode OCT images is studied. The percentage of pixels exhibiting a speckle contrast value indicative of flow was quantified to serve as an objective parameter to assess blood flow at 4 locations on the reconstructed gastric tube. Here; it was shown that OCT can be used for direct blood flow imaging during surgery and may therefore aid in improving surgical outcomes for patients.},

abstract = {The triad of ischaemia, neuropathy, and infection are among the principal causes of lower extremity wounds that are commonly prevalent in patients with diabetic foot (DF) a condition in which peripheral arterial disease commonly co-exists. The prevalence of this condition is increasing globally and with it, the mounting costs of its management. One aspect of management is saving limbs and or digits, a crucial part of this process is assessing tissue viability of skin which is a focus of this review: there are other aspects which are well described in the literature. Amputations are offered to limit the damage resulting from acute/chronic ischaemia. Holstein measured skin perfusion pressure using a radioisotope clearance technique to describe critically ischaemic skin; he found 30 mm Hg as the threshold above which healing may reliably be expected. Recent advances in vascular surgery and related technology have informed evidence-based advice to revascularize and save limbs; in practice, this may leave a wound in the distal skin unhealed; managing these raises questions of tissue viability. Much effort has been made to manage, prevent and to better understand these lower extremity wounds using measurements of tissue oxygen, oxygen saturation and skin imaging. The measurement techniques and their relevant merits are examined in this article. Advances in wound management systems and protocols can also facilitate the repair processes, and those which can have a particular impact on restoring or maintaining tissue perfusion are also discussed in the article.},
